Explain your reasoning.", "answer": "There are many factors that can contribute to a person's success. From my point of view, education and positive attitude are two of the most important factors for success. In terms of education, the highest paid people are those who know more cutting-edge knowledge than the average. Therefore, they are valued more by the employers and ultimately earn more money. Especially in today's society, it is clear that education becomes increasingly important. It enables you to acquire the essential knowledge and skills. When it comes to the other necessary factor, positive attitude can help us get through the tough time quickly and transform the risks into opportunities. Everyone will meet difficulties when they are pursuing goals. We need to think positively so that we don't give up easily. Moreover, people are more willing to work with you if you are confident and optimistic. In conclusion, I consider the education and positive attitude as the most important factors towards success.
