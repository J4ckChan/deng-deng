What would be the most difficult things to live without? How would people's lives change?", "answer": "If I could only buy things that are made in Australia, I believe that I would have to spend a lot more money. Because China provides the largest labor market and thus the largest cost-effective production market. Compared to products that are made in China, Australian products are much more expensive. I believe the main reason is the high labor cost. I think the most difficult things to live without would be some daily necessities, such as toothbrushes or drinking cups. If I continue to use a toothbrush that is made in China, I might still be able to replace it every month because of its cheap price. But if I purchase Australian-made toothbrushes regularly, I might have to wait a longer period of time to save enough money so that I can replace a new one."}, "msg": "\u8bf7\u6c42\u6210\u529f\uff01"}
