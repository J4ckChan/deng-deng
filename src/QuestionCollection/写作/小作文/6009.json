Why? Give specific reasons for your answer.\"", "answer": "If I could create a new holiday, I would set an International Peace Day on 11th Nov because it is the end date of the First World War. Countries always started wars for the authorities' profits. However, the people who experienced the trauma and suffering were all innocent citizens. In the first world war, soldiers from opposing armies celebrated Christmas together, and after the holiday, they were forced to stay back in their position and kill each other. Wars are so cruel. Everyone in this world should have their voice against wars, so that is why I want a day to remind people, peace is the most basic sympathetic thing in humanity.", "difficulty": 2, "difficultyName": "\u4e00\u822c\uff08105~115\uff09"}, "msg": "\u8bf7\u6c42\u6210\u529f\uff01"}
