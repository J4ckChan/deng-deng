Discuss both perspectives, giving examples from your own experience and observation.", "answer": "There has been an argument about whether traditional art forms should be protected or keep artists from becoming more imaginative. I will discuss both perspectives in this essay and give examples from my own experience and observation. Traditional art forms should be protected because they represent the cultural origin of a particular ethnic group. If these forms are lost, it would be a shame. However, too much protection may prevent artists from becoming more imaginative. After all, the essence of human society is to develop and create. Overall, it is important that we value and protect our past but also make sure that our development is not held back by the past."}, "msg": "\u8bf7\u6c42\u6210\u529f\uff01"}
