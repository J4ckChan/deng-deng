What is it about this city or country that you think makes it a good place to study? What would you hope to accomplish while you are there?", "answer": "When it comes to a country I would like to go to study, the first one comes into my mind is the UK. The first and foremost reason I pick the UK is that it boasts a number of world's top-ranked universities such as the University of Cambridge and the University of Oxford. There is no doubt that by completing a degree at those universities, my qualification would be highly valued by potential employers, which would be a huge advantage for my job hunting after graduation. Apart from that, the UK's distinctly rich historical heritage makes it one of the most fascinating country to visit. Because of that, I can immerse myself into a magnificent English culture during my free time. To put it in a nutshell, during my stay over there, I hope to obtain a master degree as well as to visit all the tourists' attractions. (148\u5b57)"}, "msg": "\u8bf7\u6c42\u6210\u529f\uff01"}
