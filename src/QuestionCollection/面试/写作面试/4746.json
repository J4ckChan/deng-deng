How can you improve this area of your studies? Who can you ask for help, and what would you expect to learn from them?", "answer": "In China, school days usually start at 8 or even earlier. Many parents are having trouble getting their children up in the morning. It is not uncommon to see teens fall asleep during school days. Many adolescents struggle to wake up early for school. It has sparked a discussion about the pros and cons of starting school at a later time. While some people may think that teens are just lazy for not getting up early, others urge schools to consider later start times so that adolescents can get adequate sleep. As far as I am concerned, I would like the school day to start later. I can improve this area of my studies by reducing my TV watching time and going to bed earlier. In the meantime, I can ask the school principal for help so that he might be able to escalate this issue to the next level of management in the education department. But I suppose a more likely outcome would be that he would teach me a lesson on time management and emphasize the importance of students learning this skill at school.
