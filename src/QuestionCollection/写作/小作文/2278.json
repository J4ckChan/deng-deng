Which attitude do you agree with most? Why? Give specific reasons for your answer.\"", "answer": "The debate over first impressions has always intrigued people. Personally, I believe in first impressions. When we meet someone for the first time, we make judgments about their trustworthiness and competence in a fraction of a second. We do this based on a variety of clues, including physical appearance, facial characteristics, posture, gestures, attire, and so on.  This makes sense from an evolutionary perspective. We are visual creatures. When we meet a stranger, we tend to assess them by their overall look, including their physical appearance and attire. One\u2019s physical appearance somewhat indicates his or her personality, while one\u2019s attire tells us his or her taste and social-economic class, which in turn implies his or her competence. \uff08121 \u5b57\uff09", "difficulty": 2, "difficultyName": "\u4e00\u822c\uff08105~115\uff09"}, "msg": "\u8bf7\u6c42\u6210\u529f\uff01"}
