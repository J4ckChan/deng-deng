If you only want a job with a high salary but low job security, you are likely to be fired after a short period, and at that time, you haven't really accumulated any wealth, and you have to worry about getting another job to support your living. This provides an unstable condition. Once catastrophic events happen, for example, the pandemic, the natural disaster, or the financial crisis, doing low job security but a high payment job would be even riskier for you to maintain the same life level as the period before. A tough period is already tough, and you have to worry about unemployment during the tough period, this is even worse. So, I would definitely choose a job with high job security.", "referenceText": "If you had to choose between job security or a high salary, which would you choose?
