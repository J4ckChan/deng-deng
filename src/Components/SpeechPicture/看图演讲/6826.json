There are overall four people in the picture, all of them are men, and they are wearing winter clothes and hats, so it must have been very cold. Two of the men are standing rather than sitting, so the train must have been very full. The man in the blue coat was looking at his mobile phone, and he seemed very focused. I guess this is what modern life and technology have brought us. People seem to be occupied all the time, even when they're commuting on the train. All in all, it's an interesting picture that can bring us to thoughts about modern life.", "photo": "https://cdn.51ddedu.com/images/611440185732767744.jpg", "difficulty": 1, "difficultyName": "\u7b80\u5355\uff08100\u4ee5\u4e0b\uff09"}, "msg": "\u8bf7\u6c42\u6210\u529f\uff01"}
