Why or why not?", "answer": "I think voluntary community service should be required for all young people for two reasons. Firstly, young people need to gain more practical experiences, and participating in community services is a good way for them to get fresh experiences. Secondly, it provides youngsters opportunities to meet new people and make friends. As a result, they can take advantage of this opportunity to broaden their social circle."}, "msg": "\u8bf7\u6c42\u6210\u529f\uff01"}
