I have volunteered in a few events and I think it is very important that people volunteer. This is because the core of volunteering is giving out hands. When I volunteered, I felt like helping those in need and helping them directly with me physically being onsite gave me a memorable experience. I think people can do different kinds of voluntary work depending on their own preferences. For example, I love studying history so I decided to volunteer in a history museum during the school holidays being a guide for school children. Therefore, everyone should try to volunteer regularly in areas that they are interested in.", "options": [{"content": "Why is it important that people volunteer?"}, {"content": "What kinds of things can people volunteer to do?"}, {"content": "Have you ever been a volunteer?"}], "difficulty": 2, "difficultyName": "\u4e00\u822c\uff08105~115\uff09"}, "msg": "\u8bf7\u6c42\u6210\u529f\uff01"}
