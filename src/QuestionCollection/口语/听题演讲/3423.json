From an individual perspective, we can reduce our carbon footprint by changing the ways we are living in. For example, we can take public transportation more frequently rather than private cars when commuting.

Moreover, it is also a great idea to install solar panels at home. Instead of purchasing unnecessary cloth and food, only purchasing necessary products can reduce the energy used in disposing of them.
