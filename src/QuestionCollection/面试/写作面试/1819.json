Explain your reasoning.", "answer": "When it comes to the content of social media platforms, I suppose that people should be allowed to post whatever they want freely. First and foremost, the reason why I support this position is that people need to communicate without any restriction as long as they are not going to breach the law or otherwise do harm to society. Every single person has the right to be well informed. The government should be transparent to the public as it is supposed to serve the public good. Without restriction, people will be able, to tell the truth, which is meant to be shown publicly and freely, and this will stimulate the government and the society to collaborate for a brighter future.\uff08120 \u5b57\uff09"}, "msg": "\u8bf7\u6c42\u6210\u529f\uff01"}
