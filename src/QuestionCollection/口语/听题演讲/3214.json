The lead actors must be smart and witty. Any show with great cinematography and fine performances is worth watching. My favorite show is Sherlock, which falls under the crime or mystery category. Personally, I enjoy trying to solve the mystery alongside the detectives and thinking up all kinds of theories. I prefer thoroughly narrated and complex cases, where there is no surprise evidence, and all the facts are available to the viewer. It's kind of a puzzle, I find it fun. Generally, I lean towards shows that are a case per episode, rather than the same perpetrator being chased for a whole season or series. I don't really care for the internal conflicts of the characters, dark secrets looming in their past, or their romantic entanglements, that many detective shows feel compelled to tack on. I'm just there for the conundrums and the solutions.
