People in China traditionally associate fortune with lucky numbers. In China, it is customary to regard even numbers as being more auspicious than odd ones. So, gifts are given in even numbers for the celebration of all occasions. Number 8 has long been regarded as the luckiest number in Chinese culture. As a Chinese, I take lucky number combination into important consideration in daily life too, such as on occasions when choosing telephone numbers and picking an identification number for my vehicle. I believe lucky numbers like 6 and 8 can bring me good luck. Apart from that, I do carry an amulet with me which my mum got for me from a renowned temple. She said it would protect me from bad luck and illness.
