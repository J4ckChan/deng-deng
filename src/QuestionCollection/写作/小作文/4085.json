I accidentally hit the front left tyre into the kerb while turning left. I didn't realize that the tyre was broken then and kept driving. Several minutes later, when I was on the highway, the alarm went on, indicating that the car was not running under normal conditions, but it would be extremely dangerous to stop in the middle of the highway. I tried to calm myself down. I remembered from my driving lesson that I need to turn on the emergency light first, and then slowed the car down and drove to the side of the highway. Fortunately, a young man drove by and stopped to help me with the replacement of the tyre, which I very much appreciated.
