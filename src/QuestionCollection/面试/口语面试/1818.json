Explain the reasons for your choice.", "answer": "The country where I would like to spend a year in is Italy. I've been dreaming of visiting this country for more than five years and ironically an attempt to visit Italy was canceled two years ago. I'll definitely visit the country as soon as my graduation is complete. Italy is in Southern Europe. Rome, the largest city and the Capital of Italy, has been the leading political and religious center of the western civilization, serving as the capital of both the Roman Empire and Christianity. I'd like to go there to see the great museums, historical monuments and structures, cultural and other attractions and above all to get an impression of an Italian way of life. Another reason I want to go there is to visit the Vatican City. I have read and heard numerous historical facts about this country, and witnessing them would be a great joy for me. There are plenty of things to see- arts, museums, Colosseum, Leaning Tower of Pissa, Roman Forum, Florence Cathedral, St. Peter's Basilica, Milan Cathedral, Sistine Chapel, Piazza San Marco, Circus Maximus and lots of other places I'd love to visit.\uff08190 \u5b57\uff09"}, "msg": "\u8bf7\u6c42\u6210\u529f\uff01"}
