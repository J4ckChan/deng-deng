What are you doing to achieve this goal? How will accomplishing this goal make you a better person?", "answer": "At the end of every year, I would like to set a goal for myself that I can achieve in the future For the coming year, one goal I want to achieve is to find a decent job so that I can be financially independent from my parents. Next year would be my last year at university, so finding a job is necessary. To achieve this goal, first of all, I need to accumulate my practical experience in the professional fields through internships. Moreover, it is ideal for me to check which skills are looked after by current employers, therefore, I can improve those skills directly to be successful in employment. Finding a job is regarded as the first step that we have stepped into society from the ivory tower. If I can support my life with my own job, I would demonstrate to my parents that I can live on my own and they would stop worrying about me. (160\u5b57)"}, "msg": "\u8bf7\u6c42\u6210\u529f\uff01"}
