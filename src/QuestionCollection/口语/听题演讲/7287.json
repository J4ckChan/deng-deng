Firstly, all the students are asked to go back and stay in the dormitory before 10 o'clock in the evening and the tutor will punish the students who come back late, besides, our university forbids all the students from cheating in any kind of examinations and the students who are cheating in the examination will be expelled immediately. Personally, I totally agree with these rules because they keep things in order. And in other ways, the regulations can make sure fair competition between students.
