First of all, I will feel upset when someone speaks very loudly in any public place such as shopping malls or the subway. In my view, it is really a kind of rude behavior. Secondly, I will also feel extremely angry when my schedule is changed by some accident issues. The reason is that it will bring some inconvenience to my daily life.
