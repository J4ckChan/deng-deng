Why? Give specific reasons for your answer.\"", "answer": "For a friend's traits, the most important characteristic is reliability. Compared with reliability, a sense of humor is relatively less crucial. This is because not all people require their friends to be humorous. Instead, all people build their friendships based on reliability. Friendship is a relationship from both sides, so people would never expect their friends to betray or abandon them. Even if people have a boring or a nerdy friend, as long as their values match, they would still be good friends. Thus, reliability weighs much more than being humorous for a friend's characteristic.", "difficulty": 2, "difficultyName": "\u4e00\u822c\uff08105~115\uff09"}, "msg": "\u8bf7\u6c42\u6210\u529f\uff01"}
