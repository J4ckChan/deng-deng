How did you feel about not getting it? What did you learn from this experience, and how will it help you in life?", "answer": "When it comes to something I wanted but could not have, I would say by instinct that it was a car. Last year, I felt like I needed a car to travel readily whenever I please. I couldn't help but imagine that once I got a car, I could drive to and from university for classes, join my friends' road trip during holidays and so forth. I then asked my parents. Unfortunately, they did not share the same opinion as I had and wouldn't lend me money. At the very moment I was rejected, I was overwhelmed by sadness as all my beautiful imagination collapsed. Undoubtedly, the incident did expose me to the importance of earning money by myself. I leant that as an adult, I must make my own living, and to achieve that, I must first study hard and find a rewarding job. (145\u5b57)"}, "msg": "\u8bf7\u6c42\u6210\u529f\uff01"}
