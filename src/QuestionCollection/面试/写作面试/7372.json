Why or why not? What would be some potential pros and cons of allowing this? Explain your perspective with examples from your personal experience and observations.", "answer": "In my opinion, I think that schools, which junior high schools and universities can illustrate, should provide more time and resources for students to pursue projects for the following reasons. Firstly, with the help of schools, students of different ages can access some resources and try their best to seek some personally interesting knowledge. Secondly, students are more likely to have enough time for a deep consideration and even acquiring some abilities. For example, I was allowed to find out some knowledge about Education by myself at the university and finally, I published a paper about Education. However, some people may argue that doing some projects in schools will only waste time and all students need to focus on getting high scores in examinations rather than pursuing projects. I still believe that pursuing knowledge is more significant for students so schools should provide much more time and resources."}, "msg": "\u8bf7\u6c42\u6210\u529f\uff01"}
