Explain your reasoning.", "answer": "Personally speaking, the sense of responsibility makes a person worthy of trust. That is to say, a person needs to be a man of his word. He should be honest and punctual. A person does not necessarily need to talk much when he does it carries unparallel weights. Each time he makes a promise, he will fulfil it under any circumstances. And every time he is assigned a task, he will complete it within the given timeframe and to a high standard. This is exactly the way how trust is built. If one cannot keep his promise or accomplish what he is supposed to accomplish, he will be constantly failing others. Consequently, no one will ever trust him.
