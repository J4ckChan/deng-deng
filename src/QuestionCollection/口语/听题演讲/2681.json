But as time changes, some old-school life advice may not be useful today. There is an old-fashioned belief that \"we should respect everyone no matter who he is.\" However, there will always be times when someone doesn't deserve to have our respect. Respect is something earned, not something that is a given. So when we teach our children to learn about respect, they will need to work out people for themselves by their actions and deeds and will know whether those people have earned their respect. Not everyone will deserve to have it. Another old-fashioned belief is loyalty, that older generations always tell us loyalty is a good value, and we should be loyal to other people. However, we also need to know about the difference between loyalty and blind loyalty, as loyalty to other people can be blind and misguided. For example, blind loyalty to a good boss may work fine 98% of the time, but if the boss had a temporary lapse in ethics or discretion, our unwitting compliance could lead to bad consequences that harm the innocent and injure our career. \uff08216 \u5b57\uff09", "referenceText": "What are some beliefs you think are old-fashioned?", "referenceTranslate": "\u4f60\u8ba4\u4e3a\u54ea\u4e9b\u89c2\u5ff5\u662f\u8fc7\u65f6\u7684\uff1f", "difficulty": 3, "difficultyName": "\u96be\uff08120\u4ee5\u4e0a\uff09"}, "msg": "\u8bf7\u6c42\u6210\u529f\uff01"}
