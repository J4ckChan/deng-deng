She is so elegant with dedicated clothing, earing, and hairstyle. This lady is closing her eyes and lifting her face slightly. The path around is unique with curves on it. This picture has reminded me of my trip to Paris last summer. I have enjoyed the grand architecture and French fashion there. French ladies are always wearing clothes that can reflect their characters without following the fashion blindly. And they are always walking along the street, sitting on the lawns and having coffee at the caf\u00e9 with leisureliness. I hope I can still be that elegant and confident when I reach a similar age as her.
