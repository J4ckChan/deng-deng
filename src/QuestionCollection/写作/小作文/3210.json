What happened?\"", "answer": "Everyone has at least experienced one scary event in their life, either an accident or a natural disaster, and I am no exception. I still remember vividly what happened that night when I was at home alone. My parents had gone to join a relative\u2019s party, while I had to stay at home to do the homework. When I was stretching and looking outside the window, suddenly, something white jumped out of the trees right in front of me, and in just a few seconds, I suffered from a blackout. When I woke up, I saw the worrying faces of my parents, and nowhere could I find the thing that scared me. I talked to my parents about that thing, but they did not believe me and thought that was just an illusion due to tiredness. Even now, it was still a terrifying experience for me. I am not so afraid of it anymore. I think that in this world, many mystical and unexplained things exist beyond human perception.
