When I was really young, and I wanted to learn about something, then I had to ask someone who may have had spotty knowledge. Or I had to visit the local library and maybe there was a book or magazine about it. Things are so different now, and even though it is just a part of everyday life, it is still amazing. I can learn about pretty much anything online. I can add new skills and habits to make my life happier and more impressive with the help of what other people share online. Plus, there is the opportunity to connect with and get to know people from all around the world. It is easy to get caught up in the busyness of life. We often take things for granted and fail to notice and appreciate the abundance, and there is always something to be thankful for in our lives. Therefore, we need to appreciate the things around us, and my way to show thankfulness is to say \"thank you\" all the time.\uff08187 \u5b57\uff09", "options": [{"content": "Why were you thankful?"}, {"content": "How did you show that you were thankful?"}, {"content": "Did you thank someone?"}, {"content": "If so, who?"}], "difficulty": 1, "difficultyName": "\u7b80\u5355\uff08100\u4ee5\u4e0b\uff09"}, "msg": "\u8bf7\u6c42\u6210\u529f\uff01"}
