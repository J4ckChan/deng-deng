Do you support or oppose the plan? Why? Give specific reasons for your answer.\"", "answer": "I oppose this plan. The place I live is a very quiet residential area, and most of the community members are children and the elderly. So compare to normal adult people, they would need a more quiet place to live. However, highways are usually main roads connecting suburbs and regions, they are always the ways that have the lowest speed limit. That means drivers drive at a high speed on average. This high speed would bring dangers for the nearby residents and it will also generate a high volume of noises. And these would influence the local residents' lives in a negative way. So I would never support the plan of building a highway through my neighborhood.", "difficulty": 2, "difficultyName": "\u4e00\u822c\uff08105~115\uff09"}, "msg": "\u8bf7\u6c42\u6210\u529f\uff01"}
