Today I would like to talk about a handwritten letter that I received when I was 14 years old. This particular letter was written by my father and I was so excited to receive it that I read it several times. The letter was about the scholarship result and my father wrote to me to inform me that I got the scholarship. In his letter, he congratulated me and wrote that he was proud of me. I was staying at my uncle's place after the final and scholarship exam with my mother and brother. One day I found that a postman delivered a letter to my uncle. My uncle handed over me the letter as it was addressed to me. I found that it was written by my father. I read the letter quickly and was very excited to learn the news. I read it again and then informed my mother and relatives about it. My mother read it and congratulated me as well. As I was only 14 by then, the scholarship was very desiring for me. I could tell how delightful my father was by reading the letter, which made me even happier. \uff08215 \u5b57\uff09", "options": [{"content": "Who wrote it to you?"}, {"content": "What was the letter about?"}, {"content": "How did it make you feel?"}], "difficulty": 3, "difficultyName": "\u96be\uff08120\u4ee5\u4e0a\uff09"}, "msg": "\u8bf7\u6c42\u6210\u529f\uff01"}
