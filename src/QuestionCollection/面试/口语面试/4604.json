Provide reasons to support your opinion.", "answer": "As far as I am concerned, children should be required to care for their parents when they get old. As we get older, so do our parents. Difficult as it is to consider, they may one day need our help -- just as we once needed theirs. Children have wildly varying relationships with parents, and different feelings about taking care of them. Despite personal histories, though, children have an ethical responsibility to make sure their parents are safe, secure and getting the attention they need. In Chinese culture, parents always sacrifice their dreams, aspirations and comfort to bring joy to their children and to set them on a track of wellbeing. This usually leads to them not being able to save anything for themselves. Plus the fact that while aging, people lose the ability to get things done on their own and have an increased vulnerability to diseases and other bad stuff. Therefore, when parents get old, grown-up children are supposed to take care of them. (166\u5b57)"}, "msg": "\u8bf7\u6c42\u6210\u529f\uff01"}
