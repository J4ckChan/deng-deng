How do you work to improve this quality in yourself? How can having this quality help all people learn better?", "answer": "As far as I am concerned, the most important quality for a student to have is an inquiring mind. It is an indisputable fact that the majority of students nowadays have stopped thinking while learning. They are increasingly inclined to learn by rote, which is definitely not the most effective approach of learning. Students should be constantly encouraged to think creatively and critically. In doing so, they can understand the knowledge to a greater depth, and in turn apply what they have learnt from the textbooks to the real world. In order to develop an inquiring mind, I always take the initiative to read around the subjects outside of the classroom, research more about a theory I touched on in class, talk about the concepts in my personal statement. It not only demonstrates a curious mind, but also a positive attitude to study, an interest in my course and an ability to think and work independently.
