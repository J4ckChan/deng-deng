What do you recommend? Why? Give specific reasons for your recommendation.\"", "answer": "The controversial issue in respect of the preservation of old, historic buildings has attracted huge public attention and sparked a heated debate. As far as I am concerned, cities should try their best to preserve heritage buildings. First of all, historic buildings represent the wisdom and labor of the ancestors who lived in the region in the past. Therefore, they possess incredible historic value and thus are worth being kept. Secondly, historic buildings are icons of the particular building style in that area which can be turned into tourist attractions and in turn boost the local economy. In conclusion, older, historic buildings should be preserved. (104\u5b57)", "difficulty": 3, "difficultyName": "\u96be\uff08120\u4ee5\u4e0a\uff09"}, "msg": "\u8bf7\u6c42\u6210\u529f\uff01"}
