First of all, I think that kind people can donate money to charities so the organization will have enough funds to help poor children and homelessness. Besides, donating some clothes and sneakers is also a good idea to help charities. For example, I have donated two jackets to a nearby charity so some poor children can probably feel warm with the help of my jacket. Finally, I believe that probably we can also donate books to charity because many novels are indeed expensive. By reading some novels, poor children and homelessness are more likely to get spiritual power and try their best to pursue a better life.
