Public schools can play a significant role in the general improvement of their respective communities and can operate as a major platform for enhancing child welfare in the community. The importance of public education is to ensure that all members of society have a basic set of skills, including reading, writing, math, basic social interactions, ability to create and interpret directions and directives as well as to ensure that people are able to maintain a basic ability to learn, regardless of social status or wealth. For the rich, education has always been accessible. They can afford private education; they can afford to pay for their children\u2019s entire life even if they don\u2019t work at all. But for the lower and middle classes, education has been a pipe dream for most documented history. Creating free public education is one way to equip people with the tools to escape poverty, and to improve the basic skills that they will use throughout their lives. \uff08165\u5b57\uff09", "referenceText": "Do you think public education is important?
