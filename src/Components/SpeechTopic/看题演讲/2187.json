While someone might consider it okay to borrow money for all things big and small, others might be strictly against borrowing of any sort. However, certain situations in life leave no option but to borrow money. One of the most prevailing ways to borrow money is to take a loan, primarily from a financial institute such as a bank, but you must repay the original amount plus interests within a pre-agreed time. This is usually done by signing a contract. Such debt, when used correctly, can help you in many ways. However, if misused, a loan could also get you trapped in a vicious debt cycle that can be hazardous for your financial health. That is to say, if you, for any reason, cannot pay off the debt in time, then the lender can, by law, take your current assets that are equal to the value of your debt as a pledge until the full repayment is made. Thus, it is important to remember that some debt is good as it helps you in your economic growth and also to save money, but the wrong kind of debt can be debilitating and cause a lot of harm to your financial plans. People sometimes choose to borrow from their relatives or friends as this kind of borrowing probably involves no or very little interest. However, in the cases where the borrower cannot pay off the debt, the relationship between the 2 parties may be harmed. Therefore, before you borrow an amount, ask yourself if the expense is justified and whether you are in a position to repay it on time. As long as you are clear about your short-term and long-term financial situation, there is no harm in borrowing money. \uff08298 \u5b57\uff09", "options": [{"content": "In what situations do people borrow money?"}, {"content": "Who can they borrow from?"}, {"content": "What are the risks associated with borrowing money?"}], "difficulty": 3, "difficultyName": "\u96be\uff08120\u4ee5\u4e0a\uff09"}, "msg": "\u8bf7\u6c42\u6210\u529f\uff01"}
