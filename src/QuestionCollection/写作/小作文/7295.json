Do you think this is a good idea or not? Explain your reasoning.\"", "answer": "I think it is a bad idea for teachers to take away phones from students in class. Because many students feel that it is against their rights for a teacher to confiscate their phones without permission. Many are also worried about their phones being stolen this way. Many teachers do not think it is wrong for phones to be taken up, but many also understand and do not want to be responsible for anyone who takes someone else\u2019s phone. So it is clear that the right to confiscate a student's phone should be deprived.
