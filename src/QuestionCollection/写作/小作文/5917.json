The friend has asked you for advice. What do you advise? Give specific reasons for your answer.\"", "answer": "I would recommend this friend to buy a car due to the property feature of the car. A car can be seen as an asset, meaning that although there is always depreciation, one can always generate rewards with a car. However, a vacation is a one-off sunk cost. Owning a car can provide a lot more convenience. It saves the cost of the annoying commute using public transport, the exhausting carriage of heavy stuff, and it makes places easily accessible. In another word, getting a car helps to travel. So, people can go on vacation much more easily by traveling using a car. Hence, a car should be the first choice if only one option can be selected for now. It is a preparation for the vacation next time.", "difficulty": 2, "difficultyName": "\u4e00\u822c\uff08105~115\uff09"}, "msg": "\u8bf7\u6c42\u6210\u529f\uff01"}
