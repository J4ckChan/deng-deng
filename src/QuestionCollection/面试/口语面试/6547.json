Some people like this idea because it allows them to try foods from other coutnries and cultures. Do you think this is a good idea? Why or why not? Use examples from personal experience and observations to support your perspective.", "answer": "I think it is a great idea for the university cafeteria to serve foods from many different cultures. There are many reasons, with one being that it allows students to try foods from other countries and cultures. It also meets the needs of students from different countries and cultures if the university has a lot of international students. This might also be a way to attract more students both local and international. Above all, having all kinds of foods from different cultures represents a diverse stance from the university when viewing the world."}, "msg": "\u8bf7\u6c42\u6210\u529f\uff01"}
