Others like routine and want their lives to stay the same. Which do you prefer? Why? Give specific reasons for your answer.\"", "answer": "I personally would enjoy looking forward to seeking new adventures. This is because if my life is always the same all the time, then the future would be known already and life would lose too much spice. The challenging and provocative senses of life come from the unpredictable future, and new experiences would definitely broaden our horizons and would enrich ourselves. My life would become so pointless if there is no change. I would be already so proficient in everything but I still have to repeat tasks day by day and night by night. So if lives stay the same for my entire life, I would rather die because the meaning of life is to confront challenges and to get rewards from our lives.", "difficulty": 1, "difficultyName": "\u7b80\u5355\uff08100\u4ee5\u4e0b\uff09"}, "msg": "\u8bf7\u6c42\u6210\u529f\uff01"}
