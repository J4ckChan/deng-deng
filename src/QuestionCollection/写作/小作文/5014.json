What is one traditional element of your culture that you believe will soon be lost? Explain the reasons for this change.\"", "answer": "Effigy means a sculpture or model of a person. In my village, we have a tradition, which is burning an effigy on New Year\u2019s Eve. Because we believe that burning an effigy helps get rid of the bad things that might have happened in the past year, before setting off fireworks to celebrate the good that is coming in the new year. When I was young, many families in my villages used to practice this tradition. However, after I moved from the village to a big city, I stopped practicing this tradition and I have not seen anyone in the city burning an effigy on New Year\u2019s Eve. Therefore, I believe that this tradition will soon be lost.", "difficulty": 2, "difficultyName": "\u4e00\u822c\uff08105~115\uff09"}, "msg": "\u8bf7\u6c42\u6210\u529f\uff01"}
