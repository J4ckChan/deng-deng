How did you solve the disagreement, and how did it impact your friendship?", "answer": "Last week I had a big disagreement with one of my closest friends about a trip we were planning to go to. It was just after the final term exam in our university when one of our friends proposed to plan for a trip. The disagreement occurred with Jonathon when he proposed to visit Mexico while I preferred travelling to England. Jonathon might have reasons to visit Mexico, but I preferred to visit a place where I could enjoy the tranquillity and rich heritage. I argued that the majority of other friends have agreed to visit England, and the plan's sudden change would deter many of them from joining us. After an hour's argument and discussion, we finally agreed that we should both make a compromise and decided to go to Australia instead. Since then, we became closer than before. What I learned from this experience is that we should respect our friends' ideas; even if you do not agree with them, we can always find a solution that satisfies both parties. \uff08172 \u5b57\uff09"}, "msg": "\u8bf7\u6c42\u6210\u529f\uff01"}
