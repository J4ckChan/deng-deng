Who do you think would buy your product or service? How would your business be beneficial?", "answer": "I think a wine business would be a good idea for starting a business. I think the potential consumers of wine would be people from all over the world. My home country, China, has a long history of liquor culture. Now, wine has become one of the mainstreams of liquor when having family or friends for dinner. Similarly, in western culture, wine has been a cultural heritage from predecessors. So, wine's approachable consumers would be very broad.\n\nFrom the personal side, my business would generate a stable income for me. And from the public's side, wine is a good anti-oxidant made of grapes and is good for health. From the cultural side, my business would be beneficial to the heritage of wine culture. Hence, I consider the wine industry as a good business idea."}, "msg": "\u8bf7\u6c42\u6210\u529f\uff01"}
