Some people insist that the abnormal phenomena they experience are relevant to the power of god or ghosts. For example, they may dimly see the dead family is talking to them at night. This is because people miss their beloved so sincerely and want to reunite with them. Moreover, it is possible that these people are religious or mentally vulnerable. On the other hand, the others claim they don't have experience with supernatural occurrences. They think all these phenomena are nothing but coincidence. All supernatural occurrences can be explained by science. From my perspective, supernatural occurrences give me a sense of mystery that humans still have many fields to explore. And some supernature-related artworks are historic collections now since they represent human's boundless imagination. However, we cannot worship supernature power blindly. Too obsessed with supernature may be harmful to our mental health and daily life. (155\u5b57)", "referenceText": "Why do some people have experience with supernatural occurrences and others do not.
