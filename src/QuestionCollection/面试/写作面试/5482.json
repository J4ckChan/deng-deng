Provide reasons to support your opinion.", "answer": "Although some people argue that higher education is crucial for everyone, I strongly believe that it is not true as everyone has their own talents and some talents can be developed without requiring a person to obtain a tertiary qualification. For example, if a person is good at swimming and wishes to become a swimmer, what this person needs might be a good swimming program and some good support. However, if this person decides to pursue a tertiary degree instead, he might have to sacrifice many of his precious swimming practicing times with tedious paper works. As a result, this person\u2019s plan of becoming a good swimmer can be hindered and this person\u2019s potential would not be fully reached. "}, "msg": "\u8bf7\u6c42\u6210\u529f\uff01"}
