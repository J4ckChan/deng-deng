Nowadays, a lot of people are seeking uniqueness and they feed snakes, lizards, crocodiles, and even tigers at home. However, I don't think those are proper pets, instead, those animals could be so dangerous to the pets owners, and may even be aggressive to neighborhoods' safety. Snakes and lizards may have venom and may be poisonous. Sometimes only one bite from the snake or the lizard would result in death. Tigers are also dangerous, they are much more powerful than humans and they are predators, so they are likely to be out of control and hurt humans. Additionally, a lot of reptiles or tigers are endangered animals, most people do not have the knowledge of taking care of them properly, and this would further result in the extinction of animals. Hence, the pet industry should be strictly restricted.", "referenceText": "Some people like exotic pets such as reptiles or tigers. Do you think the pet industry should be regulated?
