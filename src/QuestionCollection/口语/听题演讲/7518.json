I went here two years ago and felt the joy of childhood. The game items can make me feel a kind of relaxation and pleasure. Before I went here, I had been living in a fast-paced work and life. This makes me feel stressed and anxious. However, the experience of going to Disney made me feel relaxed physically and psychologically. The fireworks which showed at night brought me a kind of satisfaction, so this entertainment project made me have good memories. This is a unique place that I have ever visited and enjoyed.", "referenceText": "Describe a unique place that you have visited and enjoyed.
