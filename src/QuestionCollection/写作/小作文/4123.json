Why or why not? Give specific reasons for your answer.\"", "answer": "The controversial topic with respect to smoking has launched a heated debate on whether people should be allowed to smoke in public places. As far as I am concerned, I tend to be an opponent regarding this issue. That is to say, it is necessary for people to appreciate the true harm of smoking, and urge smokers to be more thoughtful of others who do not smoke. If smokers are allowed to smoke in public places, then it will have adverse effects on all the people around. Overall, the available evidence clearly leads to the conclusion that people should not be allowed to smoke in a public area.
