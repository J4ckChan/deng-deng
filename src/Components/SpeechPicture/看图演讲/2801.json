She seems to be wearing a pair of uncomfortable shoes. She is fashionably dressed in grey trousers and a black top. Near her feet, this is a khaki handbag. From this picture, we can see that wearing proper shoes is very important. It can help you to feel your best and help prevent injuries. Shoe choice can affect your whole body, not just your feet. If your shoes are too tight, too loose, or insufficiently supportive, your physical activity may place stress on your feet, ankles, lower legs, and other joints. This ongoing pressure may contribute to pain and injuries. Women are more vulnerable to certain foot problems than men, mainly from years of walking in narrow-fitting shoes that squeeze the toes and from high-heels that cramp the forefoot and pose risks for arch and ankle problems.
