The person in this picture seems to sit in an airplane because the window looks like the one on an airplane. However, it is not possible that one can see the earth from an airplane. Therefore, this picture is fake or the view is fake. Having said that, I hope that one day, humans can be on an airplane to travel into outer space so that we can enjoy a more excellent and unique view that nowhere on earth can be found.", "photo": "https://cdn.51ddedu.com/images/570143104519118848.jpg", "difficulty": 2, "difficultyName": "\u4e00\u822c\uff08105~115\uff09"}, "msg": "\u8bf7\u6c42\u6210\u529f\uff01"}
