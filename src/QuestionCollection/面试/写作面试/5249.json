Why did you choose those specific people? What would you hope to learn from them?", "answer": "There are two people that I would invite for dinner. One is called Chuck and the other one is called Jay. Although they both passed away now, they will always live in my heart. They were a gay couple. The reason why I would invite them for dinner was that Chuck used to work with me and he helped me a lot with my screen script writing. Before I met the couple, I had little experience with making friends with homosexual couples. So, when they were at my place, I was hoping that I could learn from them and gain experience. Chuck and Jay did share a lot of relevant information with me and helped me gain a better understanding of homosexual couples. I was very happy I met them and became good friends with them. Although they are no longer there, they will always be remembered."}, "msg": "\u8bf7\u6c42\u6210\u529f\uff01"}
