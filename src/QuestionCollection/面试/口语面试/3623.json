How did you decide what to do? How did your decision impact your relationship with the person?", "answer": "Decisions I have to make within a team are difficult, only because these decisions take more time and require deliberate communication between team members. The last time I made a difficult choice was in last year. I was working on a team project at university, and my teammate and I had to make some choices about how to successfully launch a new product into the market with limited budget. I would like to maximize the quality of our product while compromising on the marketing because I believed customers would ultimately come to buy your product if it was genuinely good. On the contrary, he insisted to put great efforts into marketing, saying that's how a new product was supposed to be launched into an existing market and then gradually gain market share. After a long debate, I compromised, and we arrived at the same decision that the majority of the limited budget should be put into the marketing of our new product. During the heated negotiation, we were able to see each other's unique understanding of the project. At the end of the day, the project reinforced our relationship, and we became good study partners over the rest of the course. (201\u5b57)"}, "msg": "\u8bf7\u6c42\u6210\u529f\uff01"}
