How did that experience affect the relationship? What did you learn from the experience that will help you in other friendships?", "answer": "When you find out that a friend was lying to you, it\u2019s a hard fact to accept. The real challenge lies in how you respond once you catch someone in the act. The moment when I learned that my best friend Jack lied to me about the fact that he was going abroad to further his study, he was already on the plane to America. We promised to go to the same university and company each other forever. I read the text message his mother sent to me again and again, and I couldn\u2019t believe that was happening. Till the very last minute, he didn\u2019t dare to tell me the truth himself. I was overwhelmed with sadness and happiness at the same time. I was upset, obviously because my best friend was going to leave me. I was definitely going to miss him very much. Without Jack, there would be no one to hang out with. I was glad because he was going to pursue a brighter prospect. That lie broke our relationship. We never contacted since then. I learned that friends should always be honest with each other since a good relationship hinges on trust, and a lie can easily destroy that bond.\uff08210 \u5b57\uff09"}, "msg": "\u8bf7\u6c42\u6210\u529f\uff01"}
