Origami is a very interesting thing because small paper can be folded into a variety of things. Memories of making origami wallets with my friends are still fresh in my mind. First, prepare two sheets of paper, one white and one colored. Next, lay the colored paper horizontally, fold the white paper in half and place it on the colored paper. Next, fold the top layer of the white paper down, and fold the sides of the colored paper up at the same time. Finally, tuck the folded edge in and fold it in half. It was a very interesting experience for me.", "referenceText": "Talk about something that you have made out of wood, metal, paper or some other material.", "referenceTranslate": "\u8c08\u8c08\u4f60\u7528\u6728\u5934\u3001\u91d1\u5c5e\u3001\u7eb8\u6216\u5176\u4ed6\u6750\u6599\u505a\u7684\u4e1c\u897f\u3002", "difficulty": 2, "difficultyName": "\u4e00\u822c\uff08105~115\uff09"}, "msg": "\u8bf7\u6c42\u6210\u529f\uff01"}
