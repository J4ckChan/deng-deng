Fields I used to go early morning playing with my Dad are now industrial units, where we went horse riding is a massive car retail park. Housing and other developments have concreted over the countryside where we played. The town center is totally different too; the old market has disappeared, there are now only multinational companies and a big shopping center. Even the lovely old wobbly building where I went to ballet has been pulled down and replaced with a conference center. Seriously, any empty space that existed within the town borders has been filled by shopping/living space. The changes are constantly shocking to me, and I really hope the government will do something to stop those changes.\uff08128 \u5b57\uff09", "referenceText": "What are some noticeable changes that have occurred in your hometown or country in the last few years?", "referenceTranslate": "\u5728\u8fc7\u53bb\u7684\u51e0\u5e74\u91cc\uff0c\u4f60\u7684\u5bb6\u4e61\u6216\u56fd\u5bb6\u53d1\u751f\u4e86\u54ea\u4e9b\u663e\u8457\u7684\u53d8\u5316?", "difficulty": 3, "difficultyName": "\u96be\uff08120\u4ee5\u4e0a\uff09"}, "msg": "\u8bf7\u6c42\u6210\u529f\uff01"}
