What makes him or her so successful? What can you learn from this person's life?", "answer": "The most successful adult I personally know is my former boss, who is the founder of a real estate company. I believe that the most important trait that contributes to his success is ambition. He is very ambitious. Ambitious people will see that they are capable of doing their best and being the best and what they do. If you feel that you are not good enough, or not capable, then you can be unlikely to try and reach your goals of success. Having a strong desire to succeed is part of the journey to actually succeeding. I have learned from him that if you can believe in yourself and try your best, you are more likely to succeed in the future. (122 words)"}, "msg": "\u8bf7\u6c42\u6210\u529f\uff01"}
