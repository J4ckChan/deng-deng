Explain why this advice is so important.", "answer": "Although it is impossible to travel through time, reflecting on the past can be a crucial way for us to grow from our experience. One piece of advice I would give my younger self is managing my time well and finding time for personal pursuits. I used to be highly addicted to video games. I spent hours each day trying to progress through the levels to get a higher score. As a result, my homework was sacrificed for a few more hours on the computer. From an educational perspective, these games encourage imagination and creativity. But I should have managed my time well, rather than having computer games eaten up the time that I should concentrate on studies and pursue personal goals.
