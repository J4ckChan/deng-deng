What makes this person such a good friend to you? How have you been a good friend to him or her?", "answer": "William is my best friend. He has short black hair and excellent eyesight which I, as a severely short-sighted person, envy so much. He is a stocky guy who likes hitting the gym on a regular basis to keep fit, so he is quite muscular. He is quite funny and can make me laugh a lot, which means hanging out with him is always pleasant. He is the first person I phone up when I need someone to talk to. He will try his best to cheer me up when I am sad. A healthy, long-lasting friendship is generally two-way, which means I am also supposed to extend my kindness to William. He is the first person I think about when I make plans. I often ask him out for fun activities during weekends and holidays. My thoughtfulness makes me an excellent company as well. For instance, I would arrange flights, hotels and other things in a way that satisfies everyone. I hope our friendship will go on forever. (169\u5b57)"}, "msg": "\u8bf7\u6c42\u6210\u529f\uff01"}
