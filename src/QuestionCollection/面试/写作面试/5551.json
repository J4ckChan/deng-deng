Provide reasons to support your opinion.", "answer": "I believe it is important to save money. I am a very risk-averse person and I believe saving and deposit can help hedge unexpected perils and hazards. For example, if a person has no savings, then if she or he experiences an urgent case of disease that would need a lot of money, they would not be able to afford it. Also, there might be lockdowns resulting from a serious pandemic. During the lockdown, there would be no opportunities to work, so there is no income. If the person has deposits, then he or she can survive through this period but if he or she has no savings, then they would not be able to have enough money to support necessities."}, "msg": "\u8bf7\u6c42\u6210\u529f\uff01"}
