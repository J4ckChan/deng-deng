Why do you enjoy studying this subject? How will learning this subject help you in life?", "answer": "My favorite school subject is physics, and there are a number of reasons. Firstly, physics teaches people how to think. Humans are naturally inclined to take the easy road and just make assumptions based on emotions and beliefs, rather than making decisions based on the facts presented. In fact, it takes a lot of practice to train our brains to think critically. Secondly, physics explains. There is a broad spectrum of physics theories of relativity turned out to fundamentally change the way we look at space and time. These theories answered so many questions. Physically woven into the fabric of space and time, physics surrounds us everyday, giving us ample space to stop and consider what it is we are really experiencing. So many aspects of our daily lives revolve around the laws of physics. Besides, physics is a wonderful tool for math. It takes all these numbers and symbols and puts them into real world use.
