And out of all those emails, I would like to specifically talk about the email that I got from the HR of a Telecommunication company which confirmed my part-time job there. It was a year ago. I was a second-year university student, and I needed a part-time job to earn some extra money. I applied for several jobs, but the one I wanted the most was the position of consultant in a major telecommunication company. It was not easy to get the job since numerous candidates applied for it. The email was sent to me by the hiring manager of the company. It was a very important email for me because I desperately wanted to work in that company, and it confirmed my entry there.
