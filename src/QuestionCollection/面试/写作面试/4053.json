How did you handle the disagreement? What did you learn from this experience that will help you interact with other teachers?", "answer": "It was in the last semester when I found my project, which contributed to 30% of the overall assessment, was marked significantly lower than that I had expected. I looked over my report and the marking guidelines closely to make sure there was nothing in the grading policies that I might have missed. Then I contacted the subject coordinator who marked the assignment and made an appointment to discuss in detail the mark of my project. Eventually, my project was regraded higher. I learnt that when feeling being treated unfairly by your teachers, it is important that you refrain from jumping to conclusions and taking action. Keep calm, and be sure to take the correct procedure in a mild manner. (120\u5b57)"}, "msg": "\u8bf7\u6c42\u6210\u529f\uff01"}
