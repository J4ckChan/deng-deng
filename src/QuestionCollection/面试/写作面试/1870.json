Provide reasons to support your opinion.", "answer": "There are many ways for us to learn. While some people believe that the main source is failures, others insist on the opposite view.

Looking at the history of successful entrepreneurs, they had multiple failures before they then became successful. Failure also makes us find our inner strength.
