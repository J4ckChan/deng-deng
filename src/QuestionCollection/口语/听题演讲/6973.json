There are many reasons to support this opinion. Firstly, I think recycling is critical for improving the environment. This is important because our world is becoming warmer and warmer due to climate change. Secondly, recycling should be everyone's responsibility because large-scale recycling relies on everyone. We need to do our best when it is possible. For example, after drinking a bottle of water, we should throw it into a recycle bin rather than a general waste bin. Hence, classifying garbage is imperative when it comes to household garbage. Therefore, I totally agree that everyone should recycle.", "referenceText": "Do you agree or disagree that everyone should recycle?
