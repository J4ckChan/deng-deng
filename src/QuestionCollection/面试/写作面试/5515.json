Provide reasons to support your answer.", "answer": "Although some people argue that breaking the law will always be the wrong thing to do, I personally do not agree with this statement. Because of the relationship between law and morals, under some extreme circumstances, it could even put the most reputable lawyers and judges into a very challenging situation. For example, if a person purchases a type of medicine that is forbidden to buy domestically but has a huge potential to save many patients\u2019 lives, and if this person decides to purchase the medicine, this person would be considered breaking the law. However, from the moral point of view, although this person, indeed, breaks the law, this person\u2019s action could also help save many lives. Therefore, it would be difficult to judge this person\u2019s action purely based on law.   "}, "msg": "\u8bf7\u6c42\u6210\u529f\uff01"}
