I was expecting to pass as I have spent a lot of time preparing for the test. I was so disappointed because it means all the work I have done was for nothing. However, I have learned something from this experience. That is, I realized that I need to prepare for the test earlier rather than a week before the final exam. It means I need to do the review every week during the semester and make sure that I acquire the knowledge rather than only reciting it.", "options": [{"content": "What were you expecting?"}, {"content": "Why were you disappointed?"}, {"content": "Did you learn anything from this experience?"}], "difficulty": 2, "difficultyName": "\u4e00\u822c\uff08105~115\uff09"}, "msg": "\u8bf7\u6c42\u6210\u529f\uff01"}
