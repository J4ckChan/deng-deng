The evening allows me to spend some quality time with my family and friends while watching some good TV programs and movies. I also like to get out and take a little walk in the street after dinner. Sometimes, I read books before going to bed. Anyway, the evening is different for me from the other parts of the day because it provides me with clarity of mind and I enjoy it very much.
