Looking down from above, I can't really tell the sex of the vendor, but he or she is kind of overweight. The vendor is wearing a grey top, and an apron to prevent him or her from getting wet or dirty while handling the fish. In front of the vendor, there are several boxes of fish of different kinds. Some are small while the others are medium-sized. None of the fish is still alive as they are all laid flatly in the boxes rather than being kept in water. The vendor is probably selling the fish in a free market.
