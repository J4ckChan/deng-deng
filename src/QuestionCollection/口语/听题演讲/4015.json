I first saw him on television while watching the TV series Man vs. Wild. I regard him to be adventurous because he is involved in wilderness survival television series in the UK and US. At just 23 years of age, Bear becomes the youngest person ever to summit Everest. Bear is approached by the Discovery Channel to film a series of wilderness adventures where he gets dropped into some of the world's most inhospitable places and has to demonstrate some of his extreme survival skills. I admire him very much. (112\u5b57)", "referenceText": "Describe an adventurous person you know. How do you know them?
