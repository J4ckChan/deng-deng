Do you agree or disagree? Give specific reasons for your answer.\"", "answer": "The controversial issue in respect of telling the truth, in today's society, has drawn huge public attention and sparked great controversies. In my opinion, people are not supposed to always tell the truth regardless of the circumstances. This is because, despite the fact that truth is deemed to be what people are constantly seeking, it may sometimes hurt people, especially when the truth goes counter to what a person is expecting. For instance, you have never cooked before, but would like to cook for your mother on her birthday, so you put all your effort into making that meal. At the end of the day, your mother is going to tell you that the meal is amazing no matter how bad it actually tastes. Although it is a lie, both of you would be happy.
