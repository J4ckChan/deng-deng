Why does that one thing stand out to you?", "answer": "From my point of view, the first thing I will notice about a person is his or her dressing. From the cloth they are wearing, I can speculate their age, job and maybe personality. To be more specific, if a man is wearing suits, it is reasonable to believe that he may be working in a company as a manager. On the other hand, a man wearing fashion brands is more likely to work on clothing or fashion industry. According to my experience, a woman who wears light colour is commonly more easy-going than who wears a dark colour. Moreover, in some specific occasions, the appropriate dressing can also reflect whether the person value this meeting. For instance, attending a business meeting with formal clothing can show your professionality and respects to counterparts. A person who can wear cloth suitable for different occasion tends to have high EQ and pay great attention to details. In conclusion, the two aspects mentioned above are the reasons why I consider clothing as the most important factor for the first impression. (177\u5b57)"}, "msg": "\u8bf7\u6c42\u6210\u529f\uff01"}
