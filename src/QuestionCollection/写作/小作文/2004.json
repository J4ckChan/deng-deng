Why? Give a few reasons.\"", "answer": "In my opinion, traveling is the best thing to do in life. If I had a chance to go somewhere, I would choose to travel with a group of friends because it is much more fun and enjoyable. We can discover new things, meet different people, enjoy different foods, and explore different places together. Traveling with other people would certainly be safe, and we can support and rely on each other. Another reason I like to travel with a group is that traveling with friends is an excellent way to make friendships stronger and become more powerful. It's also good for learning more about your friends and sharing experiences together. Sharing your excitement and feeling during the trip with friends will make it an unforgettable adventure. To sum up, traveling is one of the best ways to discover new things, different ways of life, to meet different people and enjoy picturesque places. However, if people want to make their trip more memorable and amusing, they should always have the company of good friends. \uff08173 \u5b57\uff09", "difficulty": 1, "difficultyName": "\u7b80\u5355\uff08100\u4ee5\u4e0b\uff09"}, "msg": "\u8bf7\u6c42\u6210\u529f\uff01"}
