Why do you want to study this subject? What would you hope to learn from the class?", "answer": "When it comes to a class that I wish I had taken in school, the first thing that comes into my mind is music. First of all, music is the fabric of people's society. It can shape abilities and character. Musical education can greatly contribute to children's intellectual development as well. The fact that nearly all of my classmates who learnt music outperformed me in many other core subjects like English and math. I hope to learn their secret to success. Apart from that, an enjoyable subject like music could have kept me more interested and engaged in school. It is said that people can fight stress by learning to play music. Soothing music is especially helpful in helping people relax. And I wish so bad that I had learnt to play my favourite pop music with a piano or a guitar.
