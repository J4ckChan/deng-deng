Provide reasons to support your opinion.", "answer": "Imprisonment is an increasingly common method of punishment in modern society, it is designed to punish the offender by depriving them of their liberty. In reality, however, imprisonment is under constant debate and has many critics, leading us to question its effectiveness. Prison usually involves indignity, physical discomfort, psychological pain and general unhappiness, as well as impairing future prospects of employment and social integration upon release. However, as far as I am concerned, imprisonment may not be the best punishment in many cases. Some offenders who are not a direct danger to the general public should not be put into prison. For instance, some career criminals resort to crime because they were seeking more profitable opportunity then honest work provides. And even taking them out of society for a short 1 year without a work-history and a criminal record on top of it, makes it more difficult for them to get an honest job than it was before they had a record in the first place. In these cases, imprisonment is not encouraging them to correct their wrong. And I believe there is a better way to punish these criminals. Nevertheless, there are many other types of criminals who definitely deserve imprisonment. (202\u5b57)"}, "msg": "\u8bf7\u6c42\u6210\u529f\uff01"}
