Other forms of energy can often be transformed into heat or heat into other forms. For example, the sun's heat energy can be transformed into electrical energy through a solar cell. Heat and energy are closely related because heat energy is always transferred or transformed in some way. Heat is transferred when something warm is brought into contact with something colder. Heat can change to another form of energy, such as electrical energy, when it's used to do work. This is the principle behind the operation of many space heaters that are powered by electricity.
