Why would you do this? How would this choice impact your children?", "answer": "If I have my own kids, one thing that I would do differently from my parents is that I will give them more freedom to play. In the past, parents used to neglect the benefits of free-play, they attached too much importance to learning academic knowledge, especially our parents' generations. Free-play teaches children how to entertain themselves and helps them learn to think independently and develop decision-making skills. It provides opportunities for children to discover what interests them and what they are good at. Free-play teaches kids to play with others. It helps them learn to regulate their emotions and be aware of other people's feelings. Letting children play amongst themselves allows children to develop conflict resolution skills and learn to take turns. Free-play also helps children learn how to be leaders and work as part of a team. I will conclude by saying that free-play is essential in children's overall development.
