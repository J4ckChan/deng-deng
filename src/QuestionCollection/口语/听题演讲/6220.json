And to do so, language should not be standardized. Language is one of the most important parts of any culture. It is the way by which people communicate with one another, build relationships, and create a sense of community. Dialects is a form of language that represents a sub-culture. It is also important to preserve such culture because the dying of dialects is happening worldwide. This is because of the standardization of a named language in a country, for example, Chinese in China. ", "referenceText": "How do you feel about dialects?
