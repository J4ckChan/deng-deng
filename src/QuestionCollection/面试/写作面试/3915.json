Provide reasons to support your opinion.", "answer": "In China, school days usually start at 8 or even earlier. Many parents are having trouble getting their children up in the morning. And it is not uncommon to see teens fall asleep during the school days. Many adolescents struggle to wake up early for school. It has sparked a discussion about the pros and cons of starting school at a later time. While some people may think that teens are just lazy for not getting up early, others urge schools to consider later start times so that adolescents can get adequate sleep. As far as I am concerned, it's better for the school days to start later. First of all, simply delaying school by 30 minutes to 1 hour can have a dramatic impact on teens' health and performance. Delayed start time could help teens sleep during their natural sleep or wake cycles. And thus teens may be more likely to get the recommended amount of sleep, which in turn will lower their dependency on caffeine to stay awake during school days. Apart from that, getting home later in the afternoon, as a result of the delayed start of school days, may reduce the amount of time some teens are home alone, and could decrease the likelihood they will engage in unhealthy or unsafe activities.
