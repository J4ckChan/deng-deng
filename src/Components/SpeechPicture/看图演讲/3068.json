The picture only gives me a view of his back, and the man is wearing a grey short-sleeved shirt and a pair of black pants. He is also wearing a pair of rubber gloves to protect his hands from heavy work. There is a large amount of debris on the ground. It certainly is going to take the man a fair amount of time to finish cleaning. A black car is parked beside him. There are also a number of other people in the street, among which two are walking towards the man.
