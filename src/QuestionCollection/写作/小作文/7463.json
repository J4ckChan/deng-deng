Why or why not? What are some pros and cons of including slang in a dictionary?\"", "answer": "I agree with this point of view. Because adding new words to the dictionary is not a simple process. When people notice that a new word is becoming popular, they put the word into a ling system that includes the spelling, the context, and the citations. But popularity isn\u2019t the only criterion to be added to the dictionary, words must be used across a wide variety of sources over an extended period of time.  There is no specific number of citations or a specific length of time that must pass, as the lexicographers make decisions on a case-by-case basis. Sometimes new words are connected to current events and die off fairly quickly. Sometimes the words have been around for a while and just haven\u2019t gotten the stamp of approval yet. Personally, I want to be able to look up the definition of words in dictionaries. It\u2019s hard to tell which definitions actually represent the way the word is used and which ones are just pulling your leg. Our language shapes the dictionary, not the other way around.
