Provide reasons to support your opinion.", "answer": "There are definitely some subjects of issues should be off-limits for writers and comedians. For instance, some arguments may exacerbate ethnic tensions. Although writers are supposed to have the rights of free speech, they cannot express discriminable opinions since their work have wide influences on readers. Even in some cases, the comedians make arbitrary comments only based on their subject experiences. Their expression may offense others who are in the opposite position. As public figures, writers and comedians should pay more attention to their contents and expressions. They can present their opinion but under the premise that does not hurt other's feeling.
