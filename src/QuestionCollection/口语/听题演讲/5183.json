She is so good at organizing resources and I think she is the best leader I have ever seen. The first time I met her was at the beginning of my first year of university, she was the president of my degree's society. She organized interviews for the course societies and planed for activities to gather people together to make friends. She constructed a site to share us with academic resources and release important events and notifications related to coursework and development programs. She was being so helpful to all the cohorts. I think the characteristics that make her so outstanding are giving and being kind.", "referenceText": "Talk about a friend who you think is a good leader. Who is it?
