Explain your reasoning.", "answer": "When it comes to the importance of hobbies, people's notions vary from one another. As far as I am concerned, it is necessary for people to have hobbies other than their jobs. Firstly, it is commonly acknowledged that people who have hobbies can better enjoy their leisure time. For instance, one can go fishing on the sea during weekends to have great fun. Secondly, it is an indisputable fact that apart from joy, hobbies can also help people learn new skills and give people a sense of achievement. That is to say, people's logical thinking ability can be greatly enhanced by playing chess. All in all, it is important for people to have hobbies.
