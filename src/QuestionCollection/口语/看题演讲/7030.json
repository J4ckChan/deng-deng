Currently, only wealthy people have a chance to travel into space. Some people would argue that space travel is important because it marks a milestone in human history, but I personally believe that compared to other issues that humans are facing, space travel is merely a pleasure for the rich. Ordinary people are more concerned with their livelihood and the next generation. Whether space travel is possible seems to be too far away from them. Therefore, it is more important for governments to address the current pressing issues such as climate change. Therefore, I would not like to go to space.", "options": [{"content": "Is space travel important?"}, {"content": "Why or why not?"}, {"content": "Would you like to go to space?"}], "difficulty": 3, "difficultyName": "\u96be\uff08120\u4ee5\u4e0a\uff09"}, "msg": "\u8bf7\u6c42\u6210\u529f\uff01"}
