Explain your reasoning.", "answer": "When I need to make a decision, I tend to believe that it is more significant to follow my heart instead of making decisions logically. Although a considerable number of people may have different opinions, I still believe that as human beings, we need to take care of our mental health and make decisions only from our hearts. For example, when I need to make a decision between studying abroad or in my country, I will ask myself and decide to study in the United Kingdom because I like to study in another country. I will not consider the tuition fees, recognition degree, and feedback logically, but only follow my heart. Moreover, making decisions from our hearts is more likely to help us to try our best without regret. All in all, it is vital to follow our hearts when making decisions."}, "msg": "\u8bf7\u6c42\u6210\u529f\uff01"}
