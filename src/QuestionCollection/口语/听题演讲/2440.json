It is a chronic medical disease that can lead to diabetes, high blood pressure, heart disease, etc. The balance between calorie intake and energy expenditure determines a person's weight. If a person eats more calories than he or she burns, the person gains weight as the body will store the excess energy as fat. Therefore, the most common causes of obesity are overeating and physical inactivity. Obesity does not just happen overnight, it develops gradually from poor diet and lifestyle choices. Unhealthy food choices may include eating processed or fast food that is high in fat, not eating fruit and vegetables, as well as drinking too much alcohol because alcohol contains a lot of calories, and heavy drinkers are often obese. Lack of exercise and physical activity is an important factor related to obesity. Many people have jobs that involve sitting at a desk most of the day. They also rely on their cars rather than walking, or cycling. When they relax, people tend to watch TV, browse the internet or play computer games, and may not regularly exercise. Even though medications and diets can help, the treatment of obesity cannot be a short-term \"fix\" but has to be a lifelong commitment to proper diet habits, increased physical activity, and regular exercise. The goal of treatment should be to achieve and maintain a \"healthier weight,\" not necessarily an ideal weight. \uff08237 \u5b57\uff09", "referenceText": "What are some of the causes of the increase in obesity worldwide?
