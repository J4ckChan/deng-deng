What is the most important thing for the house to have? How would that thing make your days easier or more enjoyable?", "answer": "Everyone wishes to own a dream car or house. Some people want to own a massive luxurious house, but when it comes to me, I want to have a house in a peaceful place. It would be a cozy wooden cottage with vintage interiors and colorfully painted doors. Being a mountain enthusiast, I want my dream house to be located somewhere on the top of a hill secluded from the mundane life. The front garden will be filled with all my favorite flowers like daisies, lilies and tulips and a couple of swings for evening or morning tea. Whereas the backyard will include a personal kitchen garden with organic veggies. Well, the most important thing I want to have there is a balcony with a scenic view where I would be spending most of my time. The other facility which is a bit extraordinary is a Jacuzzi with built-in television. This would be my second most preferred amenity. The other section which I would love to have is a game section with all my favorite classic video games. This dream house would definitely make my life more enjoyable as I would be living there with all my loved ones. I am hopeful that such a house would provide me with opportunities to indulge in my favorite pastime. (217\u5b57)"}, "msg": "\u8bf7\u6c42\u6210\u529f\uff01"}
