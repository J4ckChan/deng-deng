It is located in Sydney, Australia. I went there during the open day. It looked like white seashells and it was a famous landmark in Australia. I went there because Open Day was a rare event in the Opera House's history, it allowed me to get a free ticket to observe the inner structure of the architecture. And usually, the inside is not open to the public. So I went there just to see how it was designed and structured.", "referenceText": "Talk about an interesting building you visited once.
