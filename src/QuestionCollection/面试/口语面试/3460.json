How do you think it will have improved? What do you think will be your biggest challenges?", "answer": "When it comes to my life in twenty years later, I would already be in my forties where I may live with my families and one lovely puppy. Ideally, my goal that to build up my own business would come true. I hope at that time, I will have sufficient money and time to support my family no matter in living costs or children's education. Also, it would be great that I can live in the same city with my parents so that I can spend more time with them. Compared to my current life, I would be more capable of taking care of others in twenty years. Now, I am still supported financially and mentally by my parents. If I have children in the future, it is supposed that I can set a good example for them. On the other hand, bringing them up can also be one of my biggest challenges in twenty years.
