Provide support from your personal experience and/or observation to support your opinion.", "answer": "Apparently, smart devices are better than traditional ones. Smart home technology generally refers to any suite of devices, appliances, or systems that connect to a common network that can be independently and remotely controlled. When your home technology works together in one system, it can also be referred to more loosely as a \u201cconnected home\u201d. For example, your home's thermostat, lights, audio speakers, TVs, security cameras, locks, appliances, and more are all connected to a common system, which can be controlled from your smartphone or through a mobile touchscreen device. Smart home automation allows you to tap into high-tech functionality and luxury that wasn\u2019t possible in the past. As technology development continues to expand, so will the possibilities for consumer home automation to make life easier and more enjoyable. The convenience factor here is enormous. Being able to keep all of the technology in your home connected through one interface is a massive step forward for technology and home management. Theoretically, all you\u2019ll have to do is learn how to use one app on your smartphone and tablet, and you\u2019ll be able to tap into countless functions and devices throughout your home. This cuts way back on the learning curve for new users and makes it easier to access the functionality you truly want for your home. Smart home systems tend to be wonderfully flexible when it comes to the accommodation of new devices and appliances and other technology. No matter how state-of-the-art your appliances seem today, there will be newer, more impressive models developed as time goes on. (259 words)"}, "msg": "\u8bf7\u6c42\u6210\u529f\uff01"}
