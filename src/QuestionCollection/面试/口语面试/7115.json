Explain your reasoning.", "answer": "From my point of view, asking employees to follow a dress code for their occupation is a bad idea, and I would like to give my reasons. Firstly, I think that everyone should have the right and freedom to decide what they want to wear. It is basic human liberty so no one has the right to ask employees to follow a dress code. Besides, wearing uniforms is likely to make staff feel unpleasant because they cannot wear clothes with comfortable fabric. Thus, they may not try their best to work for the company, which will cause a financial loss for the firm. For example, my best friend had worked in a corporation that asked her to follow a dress code, but she refused to do so and left this firm. Finally, this company broke down because too many employees left the firm. All in all, I think that requiring employees to follow a dress code on the job is a bad thing."}, "msg": "\u8bf7\u6c42\u6210\u529f\uff01"}
