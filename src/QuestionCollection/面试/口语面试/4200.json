Provide reasons to support your opinion.", "answer": "When it comes to something that older generations could learn from my generation, the first thing that springs to my mind is the acceptance of new things. It is an indisputable fact that our parents and grandparents are a lot more conserved in accepting new inventions and trends. That is to say, we, young people, are much more able to adopt new changes that happen in today's fast-changing world. For instance, young people aged between ten to thirty have become the major user of the internet which is a new invention over the past two decades. And those aged over fifty tend to not use air conditioners during summer and winter. The reason may be that young people are more eager to try new things and can learn to exploit them much faster. If older generations have a higher level of acceptance of new trends, their life could become much easier and more enjoyable. (154\u5b57)"}, "msg": "\u8bf7\u6c42\u6210\u529f\uff01"}
