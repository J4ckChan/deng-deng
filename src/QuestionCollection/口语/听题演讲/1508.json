Firstly, compulsory military service offers young adults a chance to learn a wide range of skills, morally, psychologically, and physically, which parents may not be able to offer. If teenagers enlist for the army, they will be taught valuable lessons that will be useful to them later on in real life. Secondly,  it creates a strong defensive force. If every single citizen enlists in the military, it allows a country to be able to defend its land and its people adequately. There will also be enough trained soldiers to protect their nation and meet the demands of a conflict. In other words, a country that mandates compulsory military service will have sufficient protection at all times.\uff08124 \u5b57\uff09", "referenceText": "Do you believe military service should be compulsory?
