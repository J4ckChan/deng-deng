Provide reasons to support your opinion.", "answer": "We've seen plenty of predictions that robots are about to put everyone, from factory workers to journalists, out of a job, with blue collar work most vulnerable to automation. In my opinion, robots will result in a great number of people losing their jobs. Labour-intensive industries such as manufacturing or agriculture rather than talent-based industries such as law or journalism will see the highest robotization. And it's lower-skilled people who may have moved from the former industries who are vulnerable. In other words, the more repetitive the job, the greater the risk of its being wiped out. While it sees the robots moving out of the factories and into service industries, it's still in manufacturing that they will have the most impact, particularly in China where armies of workers could be replaced by machines. On the other hand, jobs which require more compassion, creativity or social intelligence are more likely to continue to be carried out by humans for decades to come. Nevertheless, it's still a considerable number of people that will substituted by robots. (175\u5b57)"}, "msg": "\u8bf7\u6c42\u6210\u529f\uff01"}
