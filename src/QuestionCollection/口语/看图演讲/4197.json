They probably are about to have a performance or have just finished a performance because their uniform and instruments indicate that they are from an orchestra. The uniform contains a red jacket with some blue stripes, a red and gold hat and a pair of dark brown trousers. And the instruments include trumpets, tubas, and drums. All of them are standing in a line except one of the drummers who is crouching down in front of the line. And he is also the only one who is not wearing a hat.
