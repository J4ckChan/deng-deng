She is the most successful Hollywood actress of our times. She entered Hollywood when she was a teenager, and she has by far swept us by her amazing acting. Her films have grossed over $14.3 billion worldwide. The reason I want to meet her is that she has taught so many people, in so many ways, that if one is ready to work hard on their dreams, the world is all theirs, and there is nothing in this world that is unachievable, and one should never stop. Not only is she amazing at her work, but she has also been associated with a lot of philanthropy work that helps people around the world in education and better living facilities.
