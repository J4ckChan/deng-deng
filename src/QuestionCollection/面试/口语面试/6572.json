Discuss what you admire most about that person. What you have learned from them? If you have learned from them, how did you apply what you learned to your own life?", "answer": "I look up to my dad the most in my family. He is the foundation of our family and ensures its stability. In my life, he is my hero. He has shown me how a person should be conscientious towards life. He always helped me when I was a child, and when I got a little older, he showed me how to make decisions. The most important thing is that he never made me perform against my will or do something I didn't want to. He always left the decisions up to me, and just showed me the options. I don't have much success, but I'm always the happiest person."}, "msg": "\u8bf7\u6c42\u6210\u529f\uff01"}
