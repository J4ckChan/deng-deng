Provide reasons to support your answer.", "answer": "The key building block of our peaceful, harmonious society is adherence to the rule of law. However, sometimes people break the law not because they don't know the consequences but because of the greater law they follow: the law of morality. Whether it is through civil disobedience, vigilantism or eco-terrorism, one cannot be content to obey those laws that are morally wrong. Moreover, one has a moral responsibility to disobey the unjust laws, and to do so, such laws must be broken. For instance, exceeding the speed limit and running a red light are not allowed by the law, but when there is someone who is in critical danger and needs to see a doctor immediately, the driver may need to break the law in order to save the life. Laws are not perfectly right. They need to be thoroughly revised and amended by specialists from time to time. From my perspective, breaking the law could be the right thing to do providing a justifiable reason. (166\u5b57)"}, "msg": "\u8bf7\u6c42\u6210\u529f\uff01"}
