I personally think that it is a very negative phenomenon and may largely harm the economy. For example, fake goods production and retailing will force the genuine brand to spend a large amount of time and money on fighting against the fake production industry. Therefore, this practice may decrease the profit of the authentic brand. In addition, after recognizing that they have bought fake products, people may gradually lose confidence and interest in buying products in the local market, which will damage the local economy.
