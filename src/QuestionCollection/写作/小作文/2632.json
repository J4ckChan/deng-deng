Explain how to break a habit. Include specific details in your answer.\"", "answer": "All of the habits that we have right now \u2014 good or bad \u2014 are in our life for a reason. In some way, these behaviors provide a benefit to you, even if they are bad for you in other ways. Sometimes the benefit is biological like it is with smoking or drugs. Sometimes it's emotional like it is when you stay in a relationship that is bad for you. And in many cases, your bad habit is a simple way to cope with stress, for example, biting your nails, pulling your hair, or tapping your foot. There are a few steps that you can do to break a bad habit. Firstly, choose a substitute for your bad habit. You need to have a plan ahead of time for how you will respond when you face the stress or boredom that prompts your bad habit. For example, what are you going to do when you get the urge to smoke? Maybe you can choose breathing exercises instead. Whatever it is and whatever you're dealing with, you need to have a plan for what you will do instead of your bad habit. Secondly, cut out as many triggers as possible. If you smoke when you drink, then don't go to the bar. If you eat cookies when they are in the house, then throw them all away. If the first thing you do when you sit on the couch is pick up the TV remote, then hide the remote in a closet in a different room. Make it easier for yourself to break bad habits by avoiding the things that cause them. Last but not least, surround yourself with people who live the way you want to live. You don't need to ditch your old friends, but don't underestimate the power of finding some new ones. \uff08305 \u5b57\uff09", "difficulty": 3, "difficultyName": "\u96be\uff08120\u4ee5\u4e0a\uff09"}, "msg": "\u8bf7\u6c42\u6210\u529f\uff01"}
