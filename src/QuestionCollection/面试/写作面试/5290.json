How did you stay motivated to complete it? What would you tell someone else who is struggling to complete this task?", "answer": "There was a challenging task that I recently completed. It was finishing a puzzle. It has 2000 pieces and it was the hardest one that I have ever seen. It took me nearly two weeks to get the work done. Although I thought about giving up, my mum motivated me. To be precise, it was because my mother\u2019s birthday was approaching and I decided to give this completed work as a present for her. Thus, it motivated me. But, I had to admit that I did not work alone on this project. When I was struggling I had help from 2 of my friends. In fact, I think they helped me finish half of the project. I was very grateful for that."}, "msg": "\u8bf7\u6c42\u6210\u529f\uff01"}
