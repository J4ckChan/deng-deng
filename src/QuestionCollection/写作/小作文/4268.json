Do you agree or disagree? Why? Give specific reasons for your answer.\"", "answer": "When it comes to the requirement of studying art and music in school, people's opinions vary from one another. I personally believe that it is unnecessary to make these subjects compulsory for all students. First of all, it is commonly acknowledged that everyone has different hobbies. Therefore, it may be a waste of resources if students who do not like music and art are pushed to study them. Besides, it is an indisputable fact that students learn what they like more efficiently. This is because interests are the greatest motivation. In conclusion, students should not be required to study art and music in school.
