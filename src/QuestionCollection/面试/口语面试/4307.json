What about that dish makes it so special? Who do you most enjoy eating that food with and why?", "answer": "Chicken soup is definitely the food that reminds me of my childhood. Because it was a luxury to eat big meat when I was a child. My mom would buy a whole chicken, stew it in a big pot, with scallions, ginger, mushrooms and a whole lot of other ingredients which I wasn't familiar with, for hours, which meant our kitchen, as well as the whole house would be filled with this yummy fragrance from afternoon to midnight. The soup would become golden coloured due to the thick chicken oil on top of it. I would sneak into the kitchen and help mom taste if more salt is needed. Mom would warn me: Don't be fooled by the non-smoke soup. It's hot! We would then wait until dad comes home to enjoy the soup chicken together. Now as a grown-up, I understand that it was mom's secret recipe and loving heart that made the dish rather special, and the dinner time when the whole family sat around the table, eating and chatting was the most enjoyable.
