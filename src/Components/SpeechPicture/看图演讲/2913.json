There is a spading fork in his right hand, while his left hand is holding a cleaning cart. He looks confident and seems extremely satisfied with his work. This reminds me of a heated debate about whether organizations should hire older workers. As far as I am concerned, older workers are not a homogeneous group; each is a unique individual with strengths and weaknesses. Older workers can have a positive impact on the workplace and work outcomes when their background and skills are matched to the task at hand. There are demonstrable financial and personal health benefits, particularly mental health benefits, which potentially lead to reduced public health costs. And the positive impact of workforce reliability and stability of older workers on the \"business bottom line\" should not be underestimated. More needs to be done to improve the workforce participation of older workers. \uff08168 \u5b57\uff09", "photo": "https://cdn.51ddedu.com/images/477110187287646208.jpg", "difficulty": 2, "difficultyName": "\u4e00\u822c\uff08105~115\uff09"}, "msg": "\u8bf7\u6c42\u6210\u529f\uff01"}
