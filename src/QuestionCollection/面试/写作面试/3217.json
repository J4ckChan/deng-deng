Explain your reasoning.", "answer": "Many of life's lessons must be learned by actually experiencing the messy stuff of life, but some of the most important lessons are best learned from our parents. Parents are often a person's greatest teachers, and these lessons are some of the most essential ones. The most important lesson I have learned from my parents is that I should pursue what I truly love. Spending my days doing what I am passionate about, and I'll find plenty of fulfilment. The luckiest people can pursue what they love as a career, but even if that's not an option, my parents taught me it is important to have hobbies. Only when people are doing what they have passion about, they can totally dedicate to it and hence achieve their maximum efficiency. Because from deep inside, people genuinely want the things they are doing to be the best. This lesson is great because it helped me determine which career to pursue during my bleakest time. And now I am much more determined about my future. (172\u5b57)"}, "msg": "\u8bf7\u6c42\u6210\u529f\uff01"}
