I wasn\u2019t a person who is keen on sports. However, I started to be interested in running when I was in high school. After I passed our physical test at university, I decided to do something more. And that was when I came up with an idea that I want to run a full marathon. The process was not easy. I spent a whole semester training myself. I ran every morning at 5:30 on the playground. And I increased my time running every week to improve my endurance. What\u2019s more, sometimes I would try to break my own record to make myself run faster. Unfortunately, I got injured and I had to take a break. But I didn\u2019t give up, after my recovery, I kept running and kept training myself. Eventually, during the summer vacation of my sophomore year at university, I finally achieved my goal of running a full marathon. Many classmates of mine were clapping and thrilling out at the destination for me.(187 words)", "referenceText": "Describe a time someone congratulated you.", "referenceTranslate": "\u63cf\u8ff0\u4e00\u4e2a\u67d0\u4eba\u795d\u8d3a\u4f60\u7684\u65f6\u523b\u3002", "difficulty": 1, "difficultyName": "\u7b80\u5355\uff08100\u4ee5\u4e0b\uff09"}, "msg": "\u8bf7\u6c42\u6210\u529f\uff01"}
