It seems like the drying rack is outside of the house which might be in an Asian country. The man looks Asian. He wears a white T-shirt and stares somewhere. I think he must feel like nothing to do. Moreover, the hats on the drying rack are colorful. There are white, green, blue, and red hats. Maybe this man runs a business for washing hats or selling hats.", "photo": "https://cdn.51ddedu.com/images/629530845681557504.jpg", "difficulty": 2, "difficultyName": "\u4e00\u822c\uff08105~115\uff09"}, "msg": "\u8bf7\u6c42\u6210\u529f\uff01"}
