Explain the reasons for your choice.", "answer": "The happiness one stuff brings to me cannot be measured by its price. Actually, there are many things that can make us happy but don't cost too much. From my point of view, the university library is completely free but gives me more happiness than expensive things. During my university period, I borrowed plenty of books from the university library in various fields ranging from arts, history to philosophy. The knowledge I learned from these books is priceless and cannot be bought by money. And I have developed the good habit of reading, which benefits me for my further study. Moreover, the cosy atmosphere in the library enabled me to take a rest and think about my study, life, and future. Even I was there alone for most of the time, I never felt lonely. The expensive things may give me a moment of pride, but the library gives me the treasure of a lifetime. (155\u5b57)"}, "msg": "\u8bf7\u6c42\u6210\u529f\uff01"}
