How did the other person respond to your opinion? What did that experience teach you about sharing your thoughts with others?", "answer": "Speaking of the last time when I needed to argue my point of view, which is my last group assignment where I propose my ideas and discuss those with teammates. After conducting a detailed research, I shared my opinions on how we should conduct this assignment. Some teammates agree with me while some have raised their concerns. One student has given his proposal which is totally different from mine. But we have discussed thoroughly with the advantages and disadvantages of each one's plan. I listened to their thoughts carefully without simply denying them. Finally, we reach an agreement that can combine the advantages of both plans. The high marks we have been awarded contribute to the great teamwork we had. I have learnt from this experience that if others disagree with you, it doesn't necessarily mean that they are wrong. Listening to other's idea can also help us to learn from others and improve ourselves. (155\u5b57)"}, "msg": "\u8bf7\u6c42\u6210\u529f\uff01"}
