Why do you think that your parents are experts on this topic? What do you think your parents would advise you to do?", "answer": "When it comes to something I would ask my parents for advice about, I suppose it would be either to get married first or to stabilize my work first. This problem could be tough as there are indeed disadvantages associated with getting married before the maturity of my career. For instance, one of the biggest problems it will cause is the time distribution between work and family. Whether to spend more time accompanying my beloved wife or working can be an awfully hard decision. Therefore, I would probably seek advice from my parents. Their advice is deemed to be valuable to me because they are a lot more experienced in life than I am, given the huge age difference between them and me. Also, for as long as I can remember, their marriage has been an excellent model. For this, I wonder, behind such a steady and harmonious marriage, what the secret is. In terms of what they would say to me, I suppose that they would suggest that I do whatever I prefer because they will always support me. This is what parents in a typically traditional Chinese family will do for their children \u2013 they will support their children throughout their entire life. This has been an inherent part of Chinese culture for centuries. \uff08216 \u5b57\uff09"}, "msg": "\u8bf7\u6c42\u6210\u529f\uff01"}
