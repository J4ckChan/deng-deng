We had to make a number of choices about how to successfully launch a new camera model into the market with limited budget. I would like to maximize the quality of our product while compromising on the marketing because I believed customers would ultimately come to buy your product if it was genuinely good. On the contrary, they insisted to put more effort into marketing, saying that was how a new product was supposed to be launched into an existing market and then gradually gain market share. After a long debate, I compromised, and we arrived at the same decision that the majority of the limited budget should be put into the marketing of our new product. During the heated negotiation, we were able to see each other's unique understanding of the project. The project started off in the third week of that semester, and we had to keep the business running till the second last week of that semester. We learned a basic understanding of marketing. The project reinforced our relationship, and we became good study partners for the rest of the course.", "referenceText": "Describe a project you worked on for school or your job.
