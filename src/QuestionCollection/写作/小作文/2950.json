Why is it important for children to have free time? Give specific reasons for your answer.\"", "answer": "Free time is a good thing. Parents spend a lot of time encouraging their children to participate in recreational activities during the school year. There is nothing wrong with having children participate in different activities as it helps them figure out what they are passionate about; however, over-scheduling children with too many activities can often lead to increased stress in children and the parents themselves. It is important for parents to be cautious about how much they should schedule their children and how much free time is left to their children. For young children, having free time is an opportunity to learn self-sufficiency and self-regulation. While they may prefer to be entertained, unstructured free time for children gives them a chance to work through the refusal of instant gratification, find a different activity, and learn how to handle their emotions appropriately. \uff08134\u5b57\uff09", "difficulty": 3, "difficultyName": "\u96be\uff08120\u4ee5\u4e0a\uff09"}, "msg": "\u8bf7\u6c42\u6210\u529f\uff01"}
