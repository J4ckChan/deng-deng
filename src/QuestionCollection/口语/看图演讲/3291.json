They are balancing a long, thin pole using only their index fingers. They are all adults and are wearing short-sleeved or sleeveless tops and shorts, so I suppose it is in summer. From the facial expression of some of them, I can tell the game is great fun. It requires the precise collaboration of each team member. In the background, another adult is wearing a pair of sunglasses and a white cap, standing and watching the game. Besides, the event is held in the woods, and thus everyone can enjoy the game in the shade without having to worry about the harmful effect associated with too much exposure to direct sunlight.
