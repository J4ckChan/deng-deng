Explain how you think this subject might have helped you or others to contribute to society.", "answer": "If I could decide on one subject for school, I would add a subject for learning how to do group work. When we are in life or in school, we need to divide the work from time to time. But in our education, there is no subject that teaches us how to work in groups in an efficient and harmonious way. I would structure this group work lesson to be about time management, distributing work wisely, and setting reasonable sprints. Thus, people can cooperate with teammates harmoniously and produce at an efficient pace. This would then further bring society a quick production speed.
