Provide reasons to support your opinion.", "answer": "Although some people argue that some subjects or issues should be off-limits, even for writers or comedians, I personally believe that all subjects and issues should be allowed to discuss. The main reason is due to freedom of speech. Because people should have the right to talk freely and there should not be a limitation for the choice of topic. If governments step in and filter information and only make some opinions available to the public, citizens\u2019 rights will be violated. Another reason is that if writers are forced to avoid talking about some sensitive information or topics, there might be a lack of authenticity in their books.
