Explain why you think this is so. Include specific reasons and examples in your answer.\"", "answer": "People have a few ways of entertaining themselves, and movies are one of them. Movies with revolutionary ideas can sometimes trigger the development of technology and enrich people's spiritual world. For example, the movie Avatar in 2009 started a 3-d movie era. And there are also science fiction movies such as Interstellar, Source Code, Inception, and Tenet with attractive story plots, which stimulate ideas of space crafts and inter-space traveling, so maybe someday in the future,  scientists would make the realizations of these ideas true. Compared to the real world, movies represent a whole new world, and people are easily attracted by fresh things, and that is why good movies are very popular across the world.
