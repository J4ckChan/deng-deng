How would you explain the importance of this holiday to a visitor?", "answer": "When it comes to an important holiday in my home country, I would say the national day is worth mentioning. China\u2019s national day is on the first of October. It is the date on which China\u2019s first president - president Mao proclaimed to the entire world that the People\u2019s Republic of China had been established. This particular day is to be remembered by every single Chinese people because our ancestors had made an astonishingly determined effort toward unifying the nation. They had made enormous sacrifices to overcome every obstacle during those eventful days. For instance, the two parties - the communist party and the democrat party - had waged a fierce war against the Japanese army for eight years, and eventually won the war at a great cost. Since the national day in 1949, China has seen an overall development at an amazingly fast pace. Therefore, all Chinese people should be grateful for those who had made contributions to the decent life we are enjoying now. For all those, the national day is the most significant holiday in my home country.\uff08187 \u5b57\uff09"}, "msg": "\u8bf7\u6c42\u6210\u529f\uff01"}
