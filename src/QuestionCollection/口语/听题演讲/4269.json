When I have a problem or a challenge, I can always talk to them. Listening can be hard. What I appreciate the most about them is that they're great listeners. I feel like I can tell them anything and that they truly hear me, lovingly and non-judgmentally. They pay closer attention to moments when I seemed genuinely overwhelmed by difficulties and give me a hand in overcoming them.
