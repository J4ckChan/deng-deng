Antibiotics are powerful medications that help our bodies ward off diseases caused by bacteria. When antibiotics are used appropriately, they can quickly and effectively eliminate infections, making us feel better in a matter of days, and in many cases, antibiotics can save people's lives. Antibiotics can slow the growth of and kill many types of infection. In some cases, such as before surgery, antibiotics can prevent infection from occurring. Antibiotics are fast-acting; some will begin working within a few hours. They are easy to take: most antibiotics are oral medications.
