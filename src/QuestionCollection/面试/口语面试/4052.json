How would that purchase make your life easier or more enjoyable? How will you save or borrow the money to make the purchase?", "answer": "Buying a house has long been a staple of the Chinese dream - go to college, get a job, get married, buy a house, and have some kids. Home buying is just one of the things I have to check off the list in order to be considered a grown-up. So, homeownership is my priority this year. Another major reason supporting my purchase is that investing in property is a proven path to long-term wealth. This means that I would have to choose a property that is highly likely to increase in value. My parents would probably be in favour of my purchase as one of the biggest wishes of typical Chinese parents is their children's settlement in capital cities, and a good settlement involves the ownership of a decent house. Therefore, they would probably lend me money to pay the down payment of the house, and the subsequent instalments would have to be on myself. (156\u5b57)"}, "msg": "\u8bf7\u6c42\u6210\u529f\uff01"}
