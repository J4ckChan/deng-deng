The working class has a lower quality of living compared to the middle class. They need to concern about the pressure on the living qualities and related problems. For example, premature death risks. If they experience premature death, then their dependent may not have enough financial support to keep surviving. Instead, the middle class usually has solid deposit and do not need to concern the dependents' living issues associated with their premature death. By contrast, the middle class does not struggle with living, but they are concerned about the education of the next generation a lot, and they wish to accumulate wealth to prevent sudden financial crises.", "referenceText": "What are some issues that concern the working class and the middle class in your country right now?", "referenceTranslate": "\u73b0\u5728\u4f60\u4eec\u56fd\u5bb6\u7684\u5de5\u4eba\u9636\u7ea7\u548c\u4e2d\u4ea7\u9636\u7ea7\u5173\u5fc3\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u662f\u4ec0\u4e48?", "difficulty": 3, "difficultyName": "\u96be\uff08120\u4ee5\u4e0a\uff09"}, "msg": "\u8bf7\u6c42\u6210\u529f\uff01"}
