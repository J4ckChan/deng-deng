Who taught you this, and how did you thank them for it? How will you use this knowledge to help you in the future?", "answer": "The last thing I have learned is that listening to others is one of the best social skills. Some people told me multiple times that they know how to listen. This was a bit confusing for me because I've never understood how you could not listen to others. I've noticed that we are too selfish nowadays, and we are too focused on ourselves to listen to others. I have learned it from one of my friends, who is always the most popular one in any group. He told me that we are just not interested in others. However, being a bit curious, and listening deeply to others makes you a great friend, girl/boyfriend, and even a better human. This is really beneficial for building good relationships with others, and to show my gratefulness, I invited him to a big dinner. In the future, I will focus on what others talk and figure out what their true meanings are.\uff08158 \u5b57\uff09"}, "msg": "\u8bf7\u6c42\u6210\u529f\uff01"}
