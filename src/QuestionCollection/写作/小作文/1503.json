What happened? Include specific details in your answer.\"", "answer": "Speaking of a time when someone was treated unfairly, the first thing that jumps to my mind is the small incident that happened to my friend a few days ago. My friend Amy was waiting in line, suddenly the lady who stood in front of her turned around and asked her to go back to her own country. My friend was astonished by her words and felt sad about herself. Discrimination always happens when you are alone in a foreign country.
