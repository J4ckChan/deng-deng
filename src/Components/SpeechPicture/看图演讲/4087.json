It's probably a warm summer day because the glorious sunlight is shining upon the dog, and the dog dares to go into the water, which indicates the water must not be too cold. The dog is licking its nose, has beautiful golden hair, and is raising its tail upward. It seems like it is enjoying the play in the water very much. The water is green and seems clean as there is no litter in it.
