Explain your reasoning.", "answer": "As far as I am concerned, dreams reveal unconscious desires and wishes. There is an old Chinese saying: \"What you think about in the day, you will dream of it at night.\" Dreams about flying are experienced by many. They can be exciting and even liberating but they can sometimes be quite frightening, especially for those afraid of heights. Such dreams often represent two very different sides. On the one hand, such dreams can represent feelings of freedom and independence. On the other hand, they can also indicate a desire to flee or escape from the realities of life. Because it often involves positive feelings of pleasure, flying may represent a deep desire for freedom from social norms and restraints. The things you experience in your dreams are probably a reflection of the concerns you face in your daily existence. That is to say, dreams may be considered as a reflection of your waking life, mirroring your fears, anxieties, desires, hopes, and aspirations for the future.
