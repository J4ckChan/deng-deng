The following are my reasons. First of all, I am not good at cooking any kind of cuisine and I can hardly eat what I cook. However, there are plenty of tasty dishes at the restaurant so I can enjoy myself here. Secondly, I am very busy with my daily work and I always need to work from 9 am until 9 pm so eating at some famous restaurants is the best and most convenient choice for me. All in all, I prefer to go out to eat, especially at some well-known restaurants.", "referenceText": "Do you prefer to cook dinner at home or go out to eat why?", "referenceTranslate": "\u4f60\u559c\u6b22\u5728\u5bb6\u505a\u996d\u8fd8\u662f\u51fa\u53bb\u5403\u4e3a\u4ec0\u4e48?", "difficulty": 1, "difficultyName": "\u7b80\u5355\uff08100\u4ee5\u4e0b\uff09"}, "msg": "\u8bf7\u6c42\u6210\u529f\uff01"}
