It is a national public fundraising organization. The mission of CRCF is to raise funds and to carry out various charity projects to assist the people with the most needs. The Chinese Red Cross Foundation was registered in 1996, but its development has rocketed in the past three years with the appointment of a new management board. Since the change in 2018, the foundation has achieved dramatic increases in fundraising, project execution, and brand building. The reason for its large membership lies in the aim of this organization, which is making our country a more beautiful place to live. More than 10 million people had benefited from the clinics, schools, and libraries the foundation had built throughout the country by the end of 2019. Besides, with the development of the economy, more and more people are willing to help others and contribute themselves to the development of our country. \uff08161 \u5b57\uff09", "referenceText": "What groups or organizations have large memberships in your country, why do you think that is?", "referenceTranslate": "\u5728\u4f60\u7684\u56fd\u5bb6\uff0c\u54ea\u4e9b\u56e2\u4f53\u6216\u7ec4\u7ec7\u6709\u8f83\u5927\u7684\u4f1a\u5458\u4eba\u6570?\u4f60\u8ba4\u4e3a\u539f\u56e0\u662f\u4ec0\u4e48\uff1f", "difficulty": 3, "difficultyName": "\u96be\uff08120\u4ee5\u4e0a\uff09"}, "msg": "\u8bf7\u6c42\u6210\u529f\uff01"}
