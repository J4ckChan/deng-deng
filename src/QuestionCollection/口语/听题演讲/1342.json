I realized that the reason the process was slow was that I had to work with multiple spreadsheets of data. It would be faster if I could combine the data and then pull reports from the consolidated sheet. I documented the process to demonstrate how it was inefficient and to provide a comparison with the proposed change. I also wrote down what the data needed to look like and how often it needs to be refreshed from the sources after the data is consolidated in one place. I talked with my boss about the proposed change. I then created a template for the consolidated sheet and the scripts necessary to import the data. Then I saved the template to the cloud drive so that my colleagues could access it as well. I also wrote down what needed to be done to maintain the new sheet and pull reports as new standard operating procedures. Once we rolled out this process to all of the analysts, we saw an immediate improvement of 20% less time needed to research bills. We also saw a 10% increase in our customer satisfaction surveys.\uff08210 \u5b57\uff09", "referenceText": "Describe a time-consuming process you went through.", "referenceTranslate": "\u63cf\u8ff0\u4f60\u7ecf\u5386\u7684\u4e00\u4e2a\u8017\u65f6\u7684\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002", "difficulty": 1, "difficultyName": "\u7b80\u5355\uff08100\u4ee5\u4e0b\uff09"}, "msg": "\u8bf7\u6c42\u6210\u529f\uff01"}
