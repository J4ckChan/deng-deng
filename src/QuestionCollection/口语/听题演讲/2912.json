Regulation helps make sure that banks have good management so they don't make bad investments or are too risky. Several ways are accounting for the regulation of the banking industry. Firstly, the government should try to prevent bank failures and losses to depositors by strictly regulating the financial system and by close supervision and detailed bank examinations. Banks are required to maintain deposit insurance, minimum capital requirements, and to restrict their holdings to less risky assets, such as government bonds. Moreover, banks must adhere to standard accounting procedures and disclose certain information that may affect their viability. In conclusion, banks are essential components of any modern economy; therefore, strict regulations should be adopted in the banking industry. \uff08155 \u5b57\uff09", "referenceText": "In what ways do you believe the banking industry should be regulated.", "referenceTranslate": "\u4f60\u8ba4\u4e3a\u5e94\u8be5\u4ee5\u4f55\u79cd\u65b9\u5f0f\u76d1\u7ba1\u94f6\u884c\u4e1a?", "difficulty": 2, "difficultyName": "\u4e00\u822c\uff08105~115\uff09"}, "msg": "\u8bf7\u6c42\u6210\u529f\uff01"}
