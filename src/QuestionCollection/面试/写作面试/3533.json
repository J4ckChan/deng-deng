Who do you think would buy your product or service? How would your business be beneficial?", "answer": "From my point of view, selling second-hand online could be a good business idea. In my plan, the individual sellers are allowed to sell their second-hand items on the websites while buyers can also browse and enquiry for details online. As the third-party, my business can provide a guarantee to both parties so that they can trade with each other without worrying fraud. The young generation is regarded as the potential customers who are more likely to shop online and buy used stuffs. And they always have many spare items that need to be sold.  More importantly, selling unused items to others can avoid waste. (105\u5b57)"}, "msg": "\u8bf7\u6c42\u6210\u529f\uff01"}
