Explain your reasoning.", "answer": "The controversial topic about lying without saying a word has engendered an impassioned debate. A considerable number of people dispute that it is possible for someone to lie without ever saying a word, whereas I am predisposed to advocate that lying without saying is not possible. Undeniably, it is indispensable to acknowledge the significance of oral communication. If people are not allowed to speak any words but to tell a lie, which means that they can only do it by using body language, then the lie telling would not be completed. This is because the information people can communicate via body language is limited. (104\u5b57)"}, "msg": "\u8bf7\u6c42\u6210\u529f\uff01"}
