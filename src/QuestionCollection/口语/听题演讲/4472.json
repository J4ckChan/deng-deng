Cycling is one of my favorite activities. A couple of years ago, when I was still a university student, I often went cycling when I felt down or stressed. For me, cycling is a very relaxing and enjoyable activity. When I'm doing cycling, I'll forget all of the annoying troubles and difficulties I met in my life, instead, I will focus on the picturesque sceneries alongside the road. In addition, doing cycling enables me to build up my muscle and thus helps me keep fit. I also feel much more positive after doing this aerobic exercise because it can assist my body to release dopamine and thus let me feel pleasant.
