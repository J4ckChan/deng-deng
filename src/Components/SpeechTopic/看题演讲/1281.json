    "subject": "Talk about a virtual art gallery.",
    "answer": "First of all, virtual art galleries can enrich students' learning. Students can visually see what they have learned and got a more accurate idea of an abstract concept. It can also offer savings in terms of reasonable costs because students can save time, money, and effort required when visiting physical exhibitions. Therefore, it is convenient for students to take a tour through the internet to a virtual art gallery. It would also be interesting to have such experience as it is so different from the real art gallery. As I have never experienced it before, I would try visiting the virtual gallery first and then decide whether it is better than a real one. (114 \u5b57)",
