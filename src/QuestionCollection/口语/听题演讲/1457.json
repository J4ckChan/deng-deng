An irregular work schedule can also cause insomnia as well as excessive use of alcohol or illicit drugs. Speaking of combating insomnia, I think establishing certain set routines can help. Examples of these routines include going to bed and getting up at the same time every day, avoiding napping, avoiding caffeine, nicotine, alcohol, and eating massively late in the day. Exercising regularly, and relaxing during the hour before you go to sleep and creating a comfortable environment suited for sleep can be helpful. Finally, if you still cannot fall asleep, I suggest you do not toss and turn all night. You can get up and read or do something that is not overly stimulating until you feel sleepy again.
