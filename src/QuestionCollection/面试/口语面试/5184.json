Why did it not meet your expectations? What did you learn from this experience about buying new products?", "answer": "The last time that I bought a disappointing product was the horrible online shopping experience from Oroton. I bought two cross-body bags as gifts to my mom and my delivery has been lost during transit. When I emailed Oroton and they said that was not their obligation during the post. However, they are the ones who picked the shipping plan and I did not get a chance to choose the delivery plans. At last, the post office contacted them and I finally got the refund after a month. After that, I started to purchase extra shipping insurance when buying new products."}, "msg": "\u8bf7\u6c42\u6210\u529f\uff01"}
