How do you think learning more about this topic would help you and others in the future?", "answer": "I wish I would have been able to learn more about soft skills back in school so that I could be a competitive candidate when seeking a job. The first soft skill I would have wished to learn more about is the failure project. When one confronts a failure, if the failure can be responded to positively by analyzing the failure, learning and improving from the failure, and moving forward from the failure, then the person overcomes the failure. Another thing I would like to learn more about is stepping outside of my comfort zone. Confronting challenges is hard, and confronting challenges bravely is even harder. However, challenges help us learn, so the challenge is a significant tool for professional self-development."}, "msg": "\u8bf7\u6c42\u6210\u529f\uff01"}
