Describe an issue or responsibility that will be important for your generation to address, and explain why it is important.", "answer": "Human beings have been living on the earth for several thousand years and will continue to live for - who can be sure how many more years - a long period of time. If we keep harming the earth\u2019s environment, the planet won\u2019t last long. In this sense, our generation owes the next one a safe and sound home to live in. Therefore, it will make the planet more sustainable if our generation can help protect the environment. One of the most imperative things is to reduce the pace of global warming. To begin with, we can make smart choices by using energy-efficient products. In order to do this, it is critically important that we understand which areas of their life generate the most carbon emissions. In most cases, it would be the personal vehicles and electric appliances that contribute the most to global warming. Therefore, firstly, we can opt to travel to and from universities, workplaces, and shopping malls by public transportation, such as buses and undergrounds, rather than private cars, which can help reduce greenhouse gasses emission by a great amount. Secondly, household appliances such as air-conditioners, televisions, washing machines, etc. normally consume the most power. Hence, we need to look at the energy consumption ratings when we plan to buy those items specifically. Apart from acting on our own, it is strongly advisable that we should also raise the awareness of protecting the environment among our parents, relatives, and all other people around us. \uff08251 \u5b57\uff09"}, "msg": "\u8bf7\u6c42\u6210\u529f\uff01"}
