The risk factors for why these people get involved in criminality also need to be clearly diagnosed and complemented with a treatment plan that involves the family and community. Apart from actions on law enforcement, governments can invest in protective factors. That is to say, supporting proactive community associations and schools to activate their involvement, educating people and school kids about social responsibilities, and informing them about the harmful effects associated with crimes. A systematic, integrated, coordinated approach combing the responsibilities of a wide range of state and non-state actors will be needed to combat crimes. It will ensure, for example, that the police, municipalities, and intelligence services can quickly exchange descriptions of offenders, fingerprints, and car registration numbers. In doing so, criminals can be arrested much faster.", "referenceText": "What are ways that government can combat crimes, such as illegal drug use, larceny, or vandalism?", "referenceTranslate": "\u653f\u5e9c\u6709\u4ec0\u4e48\u65b9\u6cd5\u53ef\u4ee5\u6253\u51fb\u72af\u7f6a\uff0c\u5982\u975e\u6cd5\u4f7f\u7528\u836f\u54c1,\u76d7\u7a83\u6216\u7834\u574f\u516c\u7269?", "difficulty": 2, "difficultyName": "\u4e00\u822c\uff08105~115\uff09"}, "msg": "\u8bf7\u6c42\u6210\u529f\uff01"}
