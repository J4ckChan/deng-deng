Explain your reasoning.", "answer": "When it comes to the role of libraries in today's society, it can be argued that it has become obsolete. While there are certainly valid viewpoints, on the contrary, I personally believe that libraries are still of great importance to our community. The first reason is that libraries remain to be the most preferred option when people need to have a quiet and comfortable place to study, read books and do some research, especially for students. Every time you walk into a library, there will be a great number of students quietly doing their assignments or preparing for exams. Additionally, despite the fact that technology is developing rapidly, there are still a large proportion of people who prefer to read paper books as they are more comfortable to read and have less distraction comparing with reading on a phone or computer. Overall, for the reasons outlined above, libraries are still important. (151\u5b57)"}, "msg": "\u8bf7\u6c42\u6210\u529f\uff01"}
