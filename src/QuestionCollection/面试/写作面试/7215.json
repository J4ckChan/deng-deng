Do you agree or disagree? Use examples from personal experience and observations to support your perspective.", "answer": "I totally agree that humor can be culturally different. People's reactions to a joke might be affected by many factors, but these factors can be primarily summarized as whether the content and style are culturally appropriate. For example, a successful comedy in Eastern countries is very likely to fall flat when being shown in Europe. Another fact is that American has a different taste compared with the British. There are many polls of the greatest comedies organized by newspapers or magazines, only to find the result entirely different in England or the United States. All of these can prove that culture determines an individual's perception and implications for humorous content and styles. (112 words)"}, "msg": "\u8bf7\u6c42\u6210\u529f\uff01"}
