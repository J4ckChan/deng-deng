Explain the reasons for your choice.", "answer": "The book that I believe every young person should be required to read is the Harry Potter series written by J.K. Rowling. First of all, it is extremely interesting because it depicts a world where some people can use magic. Secondly, despite his strong magic, Harry Potter is a true hero as he is willing to stand up for people who are in need. This quality is what young people should value. Harry has always been on the side of protecting vulnerable group and justice. For example, if someone is bullied, then he will correct what is wrong by using the magic to appropriately punish the protagonist. It is Harry's bravery of protecting disadvantaged people and doing justice that inspires me. (121\u5b57)"}, "msg": "\u8bf7\u6c42\u6210\u529f\uff01"}
