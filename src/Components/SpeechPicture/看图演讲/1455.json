On the right side of the picture, there are many green trees planted near the rail tracks, from which we can assume that these rail tracks may not have been used for a long time. The rest of the picture is about the tunnel, which leads to a small footpath that leads to the woods. This reminds me of my own experience that doodles can be very annoying when I am walking in the underground pedestrian walkway, as they are all in poor handwrites which mainly just some meaningless symbols and letters in different colors, and these doodles can have negative impacts on the appearance of a city. In conclusion, this picture is fascinating and helps me to get a better understanding of doodles.
