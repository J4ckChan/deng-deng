However, I am going to tell you about one such contest that I participated in when I was a high school student. One day I came across an advertisement in our local newspaper that an inter-school mini-marathon competition would be held in two months' time. The entry fee was 20 Chinese yuan. I had a passion for running, so I registered. On the day of the contest, I firstly went to the entrance and signed in. I noticed there were around 60 competitors and I was asked to stand at my starting point. After hearing the sound of the whistle, I start running. The total distance was 13 kilometers. I had no intention of winning but was given a medal with my name on it as a participation award. (152\u5b57)", "referenceText": "Talk about competition or contest that you entered.
