Some people think that if these areas can be developed in a nice way, it could well help attract more visitors to come and visit. As a result, the local economy could be benefited from the booming tourist industry. However, I believe that developing on coastlines or jungles might sabotage the local ecosystems, which leads to detrimental impacts on the local environment. Secondly, many untouched areas have rich cultural and historical meanings. If developers change it, these areas are not intact anymore and might lose its meanings.
