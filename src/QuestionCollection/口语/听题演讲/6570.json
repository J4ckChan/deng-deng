Since hands are a major source of bacterial transmission, it is crucial to teach children how to wash their hands properly using clean water and soap, if at all possible. Training in home and environmental hygiene helps families become aware of the risks and teaches them how to take proactive steps to reduce pollution, such as keeping the area around their homes, schools, and fields clean. Interactive group discussions, games, posters, and demonstrations are other methods that educational programs can use to teach healthy habits.", "referenceText": "What are some effective ways to educate people about hygiene and avoiding the spread of germs?", "referenceTranslate": "\u6709\u54ea\u4e9b\u6709\u6548\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u6559\u80b2\u4eba\u4eec\u5173\u4e8e\u536b\u751f\u548c\u907f\u514d\u7ec6\u83cc\u4f20\u64ad?", "difficulty": 2, "difficultyName": "\u4e00\u822c\uff08105~115\uff09"}, "msg": "\u8bf7\u6c42\u6210\u529f\uff01"}
