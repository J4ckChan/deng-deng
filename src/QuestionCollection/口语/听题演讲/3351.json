That specific age to get married is different in a different country, normally it is around 28 years old. The most important reason for my argument is that to start a family means more responsibility not only for ourselves but also for our partners and children. A decent job can guarantee the family financial support. What's more, at the age of 28, after working and living in a place for several years, we are more likely to decide whether we are going to live here in the long term and how will our future development. Therefore, it is more appropriate for us to plan the future and start a family. In conclusion, with the two reasons mentioned above, I think 28-year-old is a proper age for a person to settle down.
