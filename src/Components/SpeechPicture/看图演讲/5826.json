They wear casual summer clothes including T-shirts and jeans and one of the workers stands on a green ladder. The project is still unfinished because one piece of the wooden fences is placed on the ground and is stepped on by three workers. It also shows that in the background, the sky is clear and blue, and there is a yellow vehicle parked behind the fence. Although the sun is not included in the photo, the tone of the bright regions contrasted with the shadow region still implies the weather is sunny.", "photo": "https://cdn.51ddedu.com/images/566617580614197248.jpg", "difficulty": 3, "difficultyName": "\u96be\uff08120\u4ee5\u4e0a\uff09"}, "msg": "\u8bf7\u6c42\u6210\u529f\uff01"}
