It shows something I have never seen before \u2013 the two people are camping on the side of a cliff, which is quite amazing. The man taking the selfie has short hair and wears a black coat, which indicates that it must be cold where they are camping. He is sitting on a simple bed mounted to the cliff with his legs tucked inside a green sleeping bag. The man beneath him wears a black hood and a black vest and is smiling at the camera. They are camping at a point so high that even the trees underneath seem quite small. To me, such outdoor activity is far too risky that I would never dare to try. They must be very good at rock climbing and super bold to be able to reach this point.
