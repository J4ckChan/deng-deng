How have your plans changed over time? What are you doing now to achieve your goals?", "answer": "In the short term, my plan after graduation from university is to find a decent job in my major where I can apply what I learnt to work. The place I desire to live has changed from Tier 1 cities to a city that is not far away from my hometown, so that I can also travel back to home on holidays to look after my parents. To achieve my goals, firstly I need to work hard to study my professional knowledge. Moreover, I should conduct the research on which skills and qualifications are required in the current labor market to help me stand out in future employment. A related internship is also necessary to enrich my experience. (118\u5b57)"}, "msg": "\u8bf7\u6c42\u6210\u529f\uff01"}
