The most significant one is the age of marriage. To be more specific, my parents got married in their 20s while now 30-year-old become the normal age. On the other hand, when facing marriage, my generation is more likely to take realistic factors into consideration, such as housing. This is unavoidable due to the current life pressure on us. Moreover, young generations' attitude towards dating is more open compared to their parents, which indicates marriage is not the only purpose of a relationship.
