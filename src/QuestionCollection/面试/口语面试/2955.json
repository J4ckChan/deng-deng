Explain your reasoning.", "answer": "When was the last time you looked up in the mirror and just looked at yourself? That messy hair, that dry-dull face, that fat bulging up its way around your belly-band. But when was the time you actually did something for it? We are into a fast-pace age, where everything needs to be done right now. Working people hardly find any time for themselves. Schedule is so tight, that you miss a minute and you will be late everywhere after that, and finally at the end of the day, when you are laying down on your bed you will complain \"I didn't had time today\", age-old excuse that fits in everywhere everytime. If I had an extra hour a day, I would take care of myself. Daily in these 24 hours, I take care of work, my family, friends, issues, roommates, but this extra hour, I would just spend for myself, as they say \"ME-time\". Many times, I look in front of mirror and remember that I oiled my hair few months back, that these nail polish which is in tits-bits need to be removed, that I just haven't taken enough care of my skin. If I had that extra time, it would be me, taking care of me, as \"Looks do matter\" and when I say looks I am not talking about pink-fair skin, hazel eyes and pink lips. I am talking about the way you present yourself to others, and that does count.\uff08260\u5b57\uff09"}, "msg": "\u8bf7\u6c42\u6210\u529f\uff01"}
