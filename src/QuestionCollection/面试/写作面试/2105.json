How does the character\u2019s actions reveal their personality? What makes them similar to you?", "answer": "Harry Potter, from the book series of \u201cHarry Potter\u201d, written by J.K. Rowling, reminds me that being willing to stand up for people is what I have always been aiming at. Harry has always been on the side of protecting vulnerable groups and justice. For example, If someone is bullied, then he will correct what is wrong by using the magic to punish the protagonist appropriately. It is the philosophy of protecting the people and doing justice that resembles me. In conclusion, although it is impossible for me to have magic, my ambition will never change, and in order to stand up for people, I will continue to pursue bringing insights and reform into our law system.\uff08120 \u5b57\uff09"}, "msg": "\u8bf7\u6c42\u6210\u529f\uff01"}
