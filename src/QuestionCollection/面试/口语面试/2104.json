Provide reasons to support your opinion.", "answer": "I think young people who are over the age of 18 should have unlimited access to the internet, because they are already adults by law in China. And they have the rights to get access to the information available online and decide for themselves whether they will utilize the information or not. It is important that they can only get access to these information after they turn 18 years old, because people before 18 still have incomplete understanding of the world and immature thinking or one-sided thinking towards certain issues. It is easy for them to be biased through controversial information on the Internet. It is also easy for them to commit illegal activities online that they may not aware of. Therefore, we should restrict people who are under the age of 18 to some extent in terms of internet access.\uff08141 \u5b57\uff09"}, "msg": "\u8bf7\u6c42\u6210\u529f\uff01"}
