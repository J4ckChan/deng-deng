This little girl is wearing white dresses with colorful dots. For the background, there are tall trees with bare branches, which forms obvious contrast to the green plants and the grass. There is also a lane for pedestrians where people wearing dark and heavy cloth are walking. Behind the trees, the buildings are partly hidden and partly visible. Some protection boards are placed between the building and the park to separate them. The day when taking the picture is a sunny day as I can tell from the clear blue sky and floating clouds. This reminds me of one of my pictures taken by my father when we traveled to Beijing for the first time. It was also the first time for me to see the snow, so I was laughing and playing the snow in the park.
