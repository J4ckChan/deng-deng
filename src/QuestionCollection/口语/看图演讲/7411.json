I am not sure whether it is a successful landing, but I always feel like it's so dangerous to take a hot-air balloon. There are thousands of hot-air balloon accidents reported every year,  and among the most common are such issues as running into power wires or having an unusually hard landing. Sometimes weather, such as lightning, is the cause of hot air balloon accidents, and errors made by the pilot, helpers, or passengers can cause issues as well. So for me, I would never try something like that in the picture.", "photo": "https://dcdn.51ddedu.com/images/663678258046308352.jpg", "difficulty": 2, "difficultyName": "\u4e00\u822c\uff08105~115\uff09"}, "msg": "\u8bf7\u6c42\u6210\u529f\uff01"}
