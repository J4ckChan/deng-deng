Do you agree or disagree? Why? Give specific reasons for your answer.\"", "answer": "I agree that you should never judge a person by their looks because appearances do not necessarily mean their personalities. There is no relationship between your look and your personality. The standards of \"good\" and \"bad\" looks are not naturally defined, and can easily be influenced by a weird trend. For example, the same set of clothes can be defined as out of fashion, or vintage, just depending on how you see them and whether you like them or not. Similarly, for people, different people have different attractions. Therefore, one should never judge a person by his or her look.", "difficulty": 2, "difficultyName": "\u4e00\u822c\uff08105~115\uff09"}, "msg": "\u8bf7\u6c42\u6210\u529f\uff01"}
