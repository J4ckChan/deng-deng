The boy wears a white jumper on the top and a pair of blue jeans at the bottom. He has blonde-white curly hair and wears a pair of glasses. He puts his arms on the sides of the wooden pole and he is too big for the pole to hide him, so he shows half of his body, which is really cute. The background is a green lawn area with several white flowers, and there are several bushes in the background.", "photo": "https://cdn.51ddedu.com/images/544615184711294976.jpg", "difficulty": 2, "difficultyName": "\u4e00\u822c\uff08105~115\uff09"}, "msg": "\u8bf7\u6c42\u6210\u529f\uff01"}
