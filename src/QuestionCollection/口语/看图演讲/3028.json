It looks like the woman is in her fifties, and she is wearing a white coat and carrying a belt bag. She has dark skin probably because she has been exposed to sunshine a lot. The cart is made of metal and has 2 large wheels, one on each side. On the cart, there are boxes of eggs, some are brown while the others are white. Apparently, the woman is going to sell those eggs in the market. In the background, there are a couple of other people walking in the street, and heaps of stands on both sides of the pathway. They are most likely in a free market where vendors sell their goods. The woman is probably one of those vendors.
