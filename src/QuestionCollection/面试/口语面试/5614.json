Do you agree or disagree? Use examples from personal experience and observations to support your perspective.", "answer": "I agree with the statement that humor is cultural. From my personal experiences, I have learned Australian humor back in Year 11. At the beginning of learning the Australian Humor module, I could not get the point of Australian humor. So, I had to start from the Australian humor techniques, and those include dry, full of extremes, anti-authoritarian, self-mocking, and ironic senses of humor. By nurture, I gradually acknowledged Australian humor, and that is because I knew the Australian culture. Another example is from my high school English teacher. She grew up in Australian culture and volunteered to teach in Thailand for two years. One time, she watched a movie by Mr. Bean with her colleagues from Thailand, and she realized that her Thai colleagues laughs at some scenes Australians would never laugh at. She understood the scenes where Australian colleagues found humorous, but she could not understand the Thai scenes. Hence, we can conclude that humor is deeply dependent on culture, and your cultural backgrounds determine the way you perceive humor."}, "msg": "\u8bf7\u6c42\u6210\u529f\uff01"}
