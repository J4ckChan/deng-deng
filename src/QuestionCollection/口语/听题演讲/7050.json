One of the biggest benefits of living near the beach is definitely the view. Just imagine opening your windows to the stunning sight of the ocean every single morning. Sounds refreshing, right? Not to mention, the desirability factor of beachfront properties usually varies with the view. The homes with a better view are usually more expensive than the ones with an obstructed view. One of the disadvantages is too much sand in your house. No matter how many times you sweep the floors, vacuum your carpets and wipe your furniture, there\u2019s always going to be sand in your home. While it may not seem like one of the biggest problems of living near the beach, having to clean your home multiple times each day can get annoying pretty quickly, especially on windy days.", "referenceText": "What are the advantages and disadvantages of living near the shore?", "referenceTranslate": "\u4f4f\u5728\u6d77\u8fb9\u7684\u4f18\u70b9\u548c\u7f3a\u70b9\u662f\u4ec0\u4e48?", "difficulty": 2, "difficultyName": "\u4e00\u822c\uff08105~115\uff09"}, "msg": "\u8bf7\u6c42\u6210\u529f\uff01"}
