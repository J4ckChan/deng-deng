Has this change improved our lives? Why or why not? Give specific reasons for your answer.\"", "answer": "Some people hold the view that our lives are improved because of easier food preparation today than 100 years ago, while I am more inclined to believe that life quality is not necessarily better with the level of difficulty of preparing food. If people do not focus on the balance of their diet, then fast food such as burgers and fried chicken will swamp our daily eating and rather negatively affect our health. For instance, research published recently by World Health Organization states that more than 34% world population has health issues related to fast food eating habits. Thus, there is no causal link between easier preparation of food and the improvement of life quality. \uff08116 \u5b57\uff09", "difficulty": 1, "difficultyName": "\u7b80\u5355\uff08100\u4ee5\u4e0b\uff09"}, "msg": "\u8bf7\u6c42\u6210\u529f\uff01"}
