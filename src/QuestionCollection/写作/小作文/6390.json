But one horrible day, I received a phone call that one of my family members had passed away. This is the type of phone call none of us wish to get. It occurred with a family member who I felt was young. Not much older than me. We dealt with the situation at hand. But afterward, it made me really put into perspective how I was living my life. Today, I choose to live life to the fullest, every day. That means enjoying my work, and the people around me, trying to create the best environment and contributing to society.", "difficulty": 1, "difficultyName": "\u7b80\u5355\uff08100\u4ee5\u4e0b\uff09"}, "msg": "\u8bf7\u6c42\u6210\u529f\uff01"}
