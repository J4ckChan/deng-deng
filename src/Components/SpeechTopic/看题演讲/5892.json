The war is especially problematic for the US as the situation forces the country to provide billions of dollars to support Ukraine. This leads to extra stress on the government's financial budget. To resolve this problem, the US continues to print money which directly leads to inflation. Printing money may temporarily resolve the economic troubles but continue doing so will worsen the situation. In the end, the US will be on its own as other countries can no longer suffer from the consequences that are caused by the US.", "options": [{"content": "What kinds of problems are there?"}, {"content": "What might have caused these problems?"}, {"content": "Are you aware of any efforts to resolve these problems?"}], "difficulty": 2, "difficultyName": "\u4e00\u822c\uff08105~115\uff09"}, "msg": "\u8bf7\u6c42\u6210\u529f\uff01"}
