That includes an uninterrupted supply of water and electricity and the distribution of food and clothes to keep the warmth. Those necessities of life are of critical need because a natural disaster can usually destroy a broad range of properties and infrastructures, such as people's houses and power plants, and hence leave people with no places to live in and water and electricity to use. In terms of the preparation for natural disasters, three are a lot that governments can do before their occurrence. For example, the emergency power supply should be built in every city, especially for critical places like hospitals; stock of food, drinking water, and blankets should always be readily accessible; and communicate service companies should make contingency plans against natural disasters to keep communication service functioning even after the strike. Private citizens can also help disaster victims by donating money and material resources to facilitate post-disaster recovery.
