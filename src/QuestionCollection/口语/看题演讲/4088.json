In terms of weather, it is generally a lot colder in the northern region than it can possibly be in the southern region in winter. Specifically, the temperature in the former can drop down to -20 or even lower whereas zero degrees would be considered the lowest in the latter. When it comes to food, people in the northern region tend to have food made from wheat as their staple while those in the southern region prefer to have rice. This is partly because the southern terrain is more suitable for growing rice. Apart from that, people living in the northern region are, on average, taller than those living in the southern region.
