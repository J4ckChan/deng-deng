Explain your reasoning.", "answer": "From my point of view, the most important thing humans can do for the environment is to reduce the carbon footprint from an individual perspective. The increasing carbon dioxide has caused a series of problems, such as rising temperature and poisonous smog. To be more specific, we can reduce the usage of unrecycled plastic in our daily life, such as plastic bags and plastic cookware. Moreover, rather than driving private cars, choosing public transportations can reduce the emission of exhaust fumes, in turn, we will have clean air to breath. Through our efforts, the carbon footprint caused by burning waste can be reduced significantly, which contributes to a better environment. (110\u5b57)"}, "msg": "\u8bf7\u6c42\u6210\u529f\uff01"}
