What makes this memory so special? How did you grow as a person because of this experience?", "answer": "One of my happiest memories from childhood was eating chocolate ice cream. When I was young, my mum would allow my siblings and me to have ice cream as much as we wanted. Normally, parents would not allow their children to have too many desserts but my mum did the exact opposite. Thus, this childhood memory is very special to me because I was given the opportunity to experience a childhood full of sweetness. As a mum, I will also pass this happiness and family tradition to my children."}, "msg": "\u8bf7\u6c42\u6210\u529f\uff01"}
