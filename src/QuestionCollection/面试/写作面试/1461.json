Explain your reasoning.", "answer": "A generous person gives a hand to others while expecting no rewards. A person immediately comes into my mind is Bill Gates, who has donated most of his wealth to charity. Being a generous person is important, because helping others has a powerful impact on our relationships with others. It connects us to friends, family, and colleagues. It boosts happiness and strengths communities. What is more, when people give freely, they also put themselves on a path to a happier and healthier life. It is a process that helps the receiver as much as enriches the giver. (97 \u5b57)"}, "msg": "\u8bf7\u6c42\u6210\u529f\uff01"}
