Why or why not? Provide reasons to support your opinion.", "answer": "Although people spend time on things, I don't agree with the expression \"Time is money\". As far as I am concerned, time is an asset. How a person utilizes this asset defines what the time is. If you spend time on your job, it earns you money, so in a way, you are converting your asset into money. People learn new things and develop skills by investing their time so that the value of their asset increases. If you spend time on your hobby, then you are spending it on entertainment. If you choose to do nothing then you are just squandering your asset without getting anything in return. So, in my opinion, the basic idea behind this quote is, in the end, time is just like money, people have limited amounts of both and if we spend them efficiently then our returns are good, but if we squander them then they are just wasted and irrevocable. Hence, the saying \"Time is money\". (163\u5b57)"}, "msg": "\u8bf7\u6c42\u6210\u529f\uff01"}
