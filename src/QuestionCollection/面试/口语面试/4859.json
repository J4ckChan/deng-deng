What would your parents think about your purchase? How would your purchase improve your life?", "answer": "Although one million dollars is not too much money compared to the old days, if I could won one million dollars I would still be happy. The first thing that I would purchase after I got the cash would be a portfolio of diversified stocks, shares, gold, silver, bitcoins, and ETFs. These portfolio would aim at high return with high risk. I would not mind losing all the money if I failed in this investment, because this one million dollars would be my lucky money anyway. \nI think my parents would be happy for me and they would not care what I do with the money. But I think they would be happy to know that I decide to invest the money into the financial market.  \nI would allocate some of the funds to improve on my health and put aside some of the funds for travelling.
