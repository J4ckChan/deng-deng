Provide reasons to support your opinion.", "answer": "As far as I am concerned, professional athletes deserve to be paid high salaries. First of all, it is an indisputable fact that athletes must have trained for a tremendous amount of time before they can reach the professional level. In order to perform well and strive for medals, they may train extremely hard to push their limits, which necessarily involves high risk. Their hard work and risk-taking should be highly rewarded. On top of that, professional athletes' careers are, in general, comparatively shorter than other types of careers because their performance tends to peak between the age of 25 to 30, and then drops significantly year after year. Therefore, the period of time they are getting paid well wouldn't last long. Given these points, I believe that it is fair for professional athletes to earn high salaries.
