Why? Give specific reasons for your answer.\"", "answer": "Although some people believe that being realistic is better than idealistic, I am more inclined to the belief that idealistic people are more likely to have a successful life and gain happiness. That is to say, idealists can imagine solutions that are often unique and unusual. Idealists always see the good in everyone. They like people and are able to love unconditionally. For example, a study from Harvard University states that 70% of its graduates who agree with idealistic is better, have expressed that they have better performance at work. In conclusion, considering all the factors above, we may safely draw the conclusion that being realistic means more chances to live successfully.
