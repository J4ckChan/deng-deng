Provide reasons to support your opinion.", "answer": "Arts are not always recognized as a vital component of 21st-century learning. As far as I am concerned, putting arts into can best prepare students with the skill set they will need to become successful, well-rounded thinkers. In a word full of trained professionals and highly educated workers, creativity is one of the top skills that set someone apart from the pack. Having the ability to think imaginatively and bring fresh ideas to the table is essential to innovation and progress. Art education allows students to express themselves and think outside of the box. Besides, arts provide a unique platform to discuss many different cultures, socioeconomic levels, and current events. Through arts, students have a place to learn about different cultures. Considering all the factors above, we can safely draw the conclusion that arts should be included in every child's education. (141\u5b57)"}, "msg": "\u8bf7\u6c42\u6210\u529f\uff01"}
