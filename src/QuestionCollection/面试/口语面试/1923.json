Explain your reasoning.", "answer": "In my opinion, having an impact on the world is more important than on a few people when I have the actual influence and ability to do so. Therefore, it has some limits. Not everyone can have an impact on the world. So it is the best that we aim for it and do the small things first. However, as for importance, there is no doubt that having an impact on the world will contribute to the whole humanity, which means it has a significant effect on human development and history. For example, Einstein is considered one of the most influential people in human history. He changed the world rather than a few people. Some parts of the world may have their own hero, but they are only known locally, and their significance to the world is much less. Having said that, I believe that each of us was born with a mission to have a different degree of impact on different people, and together all of us contribute to the development of humanity. Therefore, it is meaningless to argue whether it is important to have an impact on the world or on a few people. (196 \u5b57)"}, "msg": "\u8bf7\u6c42\u6210\u529f\uff01"}
