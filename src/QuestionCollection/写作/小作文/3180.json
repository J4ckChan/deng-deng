If you cannot find a job, what should you do? Give a few examples.\"", "answer": "Employers won't hire someone who doesn't have the majority of the skills, education, or job experience necessary for the position. So, if you can't find a job because you need to boost your skill set, consider going back to school or finding online resources to gain the skills you need. Do a bit of research on which industries and types of jobs are hiring for remote workers to help speed along with your search. Some people will move to a different city, state, or country in order to find a job in their field. However, it's ok to take some time off from your job search once in a while. Allow yourself a day or a few days off and spend that time doing something that energizes you and makes you happy, and reflect on what's going well in your search. Afterward, you'll be able to get back to your job search with a renewed sense of energy and purpose.
