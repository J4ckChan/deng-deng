Do you agree or disagree? Why? Give specific reasons for your answer.\"", "answer": "When it comes to the effect of technology on students' learning, people's notions vary from one another. As far as I am concerned, technology can largely facilitate students' learning. To begin with, it is commonly acknowledged that technology enables students to learn a much broader spectrum of information. For example, students today have access to any kind of information they are interested in via the super-fast internet.
