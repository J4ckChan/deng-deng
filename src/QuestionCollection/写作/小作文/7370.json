Why would these topics or skills be useful?\"", "answer": "I strongly agree that high school students should learn some communication skills in their final year of high school. Communication is key in and outside the classroom. Successful learning is generally considered to require only half knowledge to half communication skills. As a result, a student should be proficient in all four modes of communication, which are listening, speaking, reading, and writing, and should know how to utilize this proficiency effectively in a school environment. Being able to do this has been proven to impact the success students achieve in their academic lives, as well as their own career success after school.", "difficulty": 2, "difficultyName": "\u4e00\u822c\uff08105~115\uff09"}, "msg": "\u8bf7\u6c42\u6210\u529f\uff01"}
