This child was my best friend's daughter who was very adorable and pretty. When she was one year old, I began to know her and looked after her on the weekend so in my view, she was the cutest child in this world. When she was two years old, she could speak some short stories and she always tried to tell me these stories. Accidentally, she told me a joke about a puppy who was playing with another puppy. She tried her best to give a description of this joke but she was too young to say it with logic. Thus, I laughed at her joke and her performance. She was indeed adorable when telling this joke so I could not control myself but just laugh. All in all, I laughed at my friend's daughter who told me a joke.", "options": [{"content": "Who was the child?"}, {"content": "How long ago was this?"}, {"content": "What did the child do?"}], "difficulty": 1, "difficultyName": "\u7b80\u5355\uff08100\u4ee5\u4e0b\uff09"}, "msg": "\u8bf7\u6c42\u6210\u529f\uff01"}
