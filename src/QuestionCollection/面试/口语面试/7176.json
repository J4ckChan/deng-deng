Some people believe that it is important to spend some of our free time helping others. Do you agree or disagree? Use examples from your personal experience or observations in your discussion.", "answer": "In my point of view, it is significant for people to spend some free time helping and supporting others, which can be illustrated by helping disabled people to clean their houses and donating money to poor children in the countryside. Although some people may have different opinions, I still believe that we should try our best to support others without asking for anything in return. For example, I personally visited a school in the countryside and donated thousands of US dollars to the school, which made me really blithe. Besides, I would like to introduce some specific reasons why we should help others. Firstly, when we help others, we will also feel delighted. Secondly, helping others is a good way for us to learn some useful skills such as cleaning the house and driving the car. Last but not least, supporting others as a time-consuming activity can also help us to spend our free time on something useful. Thus, It is essential for people to spend their free time helping others."}, "msg": "\u8bf7\u6c42\u6210\u529f\uff01"}
