Do you agree or disagree? Why? Give specific reasons for your answer.\"", "answer": "Some people believe that teachers should be paid according to how much their students learn, while I disagree with this opinion and I am inclined to the view that teachers should be paid no matter how much their students learn as teachers are teaching their students equally and have tried their best to teach students with their best efforts. For example, according to China Daily, 80% of high school teachers would stay up late to correct the students\u2019 homework. In conclusion, it is essential for teachers to get paid for the efforts they put into their job, rather than based on how much their students learn.
