We may have lots of ideas about how we want to make this happen, for example, with hard work, we can become whatever we want, but the problem is that life shows us something different. Life is quite fragile and uncertain. Circumstances change, things happen beyond our control, and we never know what the next day will bring.  There are extraordinary events, such as terrorist attacks and travel catastrophes. On top of that, some numerous illnesses and diseases can invade our bodies. We might have an unsupportive boss; the economy might go into recession. In terms of how we can prepare for uncertainties in our life, there is undoubtedly a list of things we can do. Firstly, setting up expectations means that you are setting yourself up for disappointment. Therefore, rather than expect the future, focus on the moment, and know what to do to achieve your goals. Do something specific and learn to achieve your goals rather than sitting and planning all the time. Secondly, prepare for possibilities by learning about other\u2019s experiences and making yourself a list of what may come to you in achieving your specific goal. For instance, you can generate a contingency plan for any uncertainties that can potentially happen and their associated solutions. What you need to do is to ask yourself what worst can happen? Think about and find the possible solutions to the problem; keep yourself prepared; it will help to make uncertainty a bit easier for you.\uff08259 \u5b57\uff09", "referenceText": "What are some uncertainties in life?
