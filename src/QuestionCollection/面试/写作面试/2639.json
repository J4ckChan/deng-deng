How did you do it and what character qualities did you display?", "answer": "Talking about a time when I faced a difficult challenge and overcame it, I would recall a time when I was in university. During my summer internship at a public relations firm, a client suddenly wanted to change an entire campaign strategy two days before launch. The client was unhappy with my team's first draft, so we were tasked with redoing the whole plan. We organized a late-night brainstorm that evening. After hours of work, I asked to take the lead on putting together a new deck. This was challenging because it was my first time putting a deck together, and our one chance to make the client happy again. I overcame this challenge by looking at previously successful presentations for the client, analyzing the feedback they gave on our initial presentation, and incorporating all of the team's ideas into the new deck. The client was ultimately thrilled with the fresh plan and all of the new ideas we included! From this challenge I think I have displayed the character qualities of a proactive problem solver and a team player, as well as hard work and good time management, I think I will benefit a lot in my life from these qualities.\uff08202 \u5b57\uff09"}, "msg": "\u8bf7\u6c42\u6210\u529f\uff01"}
