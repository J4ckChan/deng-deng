How did you stay motivated to complete it? What would you tell someone else who is struggling to complete this task?", "answer": "I am going to tell you about a challenging task that I recently finished. We received information about a very large, low priority project. At the time, I thought it would be best to continue to complete some of the higher priority projects I was working on. Unfortunately, these projects kept coming and coming, and suddenly we had several high priority projects. Despite how hard we worked, we missed the deadline. However, it was my commitment to the job that kept me motivated. I had to send personal apology letters to the client's representative, saying that I would take full responsibility for the delay. I then spoke with my team and we agreed that we would move our schedules around to work overtime on its completion. I would tell someone else who is struggling in the same situation that always keep a good record of all the tasks and prioritise them before taking action.
