Explain why this advice is so important.", "answer": "If I could go back and give younger self a piece of advice, I would say it would be allocating more time to do physical exercise. \nLooking back, when I was young, I spent the majority of my time studying, working and hanging out with friends. However, I neglected my own body and my own health. After I turned 25, my basal metabolic rate started to slow down due to a lack of muscle composition and I began to put on weight. Also, some health issues began to trouble me. Worse still, I became inactive physically and kept putting on more weight. If I could incorporate taking physical exerciser into my daily routine when I was younger, my health condition would be much better. "}, "msg": "\u8bf7\u6c42\u6210\u529f\uff01"}
