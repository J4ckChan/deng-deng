He is punctual, finishes projects with time to spare, and always knows exactly where to find what he needs when he needs it. He uses a variety of tools and methods to accomplish his goals and priorities in life. Instead of having an overwhelming number of commitments and little idea where to start, he has a clear sense of what's important. He keeps track of what he needs to accomplish and when. For instance, he uses mobile phone apps with pop-up reminders. I have learned quite a lot from William in terms of how to stay organized, and now I am also well-organized.
