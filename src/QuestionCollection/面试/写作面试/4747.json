How important is it that people think about the way they look?", "answer": "Deciding what clothes to wear each day is just one of the most frustrating things in the morning. First of all, I am not a very decisive person. Sometimes, deciding what clothes to wear can take me as long as one hour until there is no time left for me to hesitate but to carry on my next move. Apart from being charming, which requires a good taste, when deciding what clothes to wear, you need to take into consideration a range of other different things. For instance, you need to check the weather forecast to see if it is warm enough to wear skirts. Otherwise, you might catch a cold which you definitely don't want to. It is of great importance that people think about the way they look. Dressing properly shows your respect toward others. Also, dress code is a thing you need to consider before attending any event as inappropriate dressing could embarrass you on the scene. (160\u5b57)"}, "msg": "\u8bf7\u6c42\u6210\u529f\uff01"}
