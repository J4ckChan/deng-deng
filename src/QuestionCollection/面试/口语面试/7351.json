Explain your reasoning.", "answer": "One great advantage of school projects is that they provide the student with practical experiences and memories of the subject. They are much easier to recall during an exam than revision notes in textbooks. Moreover, group projects offer students a much deeper understanding of the subject. Another sometimes ignored benefit of school projects is that students build their confidence and develop independence. It will also inspire them to develop those crucial skills, and practice interaction with other people whether it is with their classmates or new people they met throughout the project. It also may help teachers to know their students better and from a different perspective. Last but not the least, it will improve the classroom environment. Students will have a great opportunity to get to know each other, particularly when they are outside of their usual friendship circles. All of these can help them to feel more comfortable in classes, which can show higher engagement and more contributions during regular classes. Overall, students love these projects which require teamwork, and they will remember them for a very long time. (181 words)"}, "msg": "\u8bf7\u6c42\u6210\u529f\uff01"}
