Why or why not? What are some pros and cons of including slang in a dictionary?", "answer": "Yes, definitely. Dictionaries should include new words as the world is changing at an unbelievable rate. New technologies and inventions have been developed at all times and the dictionary should always record the new-making vocabulary in. Language inherently has culture and society embedded in it, and slangs are a part of the culture. Hence, from my perspective, dictionaries should include new words and slang."}, "msg": "\u8bf7\u6c42\u6210\u529f\uff01"}
