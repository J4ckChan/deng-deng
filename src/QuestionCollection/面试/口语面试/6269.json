How did you handle the disagreement? What did you learn from this experience that will help you interact with other teachers?", "answer": "I would like to share a time when I disagreed with one of my teachers. It was a math class when I was in high school. I disagreed with the solution to a math problem presented by the teacher. Instead, I raised an alternative solution. We engaged in meaningful discussion and the result is that both solutions are correct with different angles towards solving the problem. I learned from this experience that will help me interact with other teachers. That is, I learned how to raise an argument and discuss it in detail with the teacher.
