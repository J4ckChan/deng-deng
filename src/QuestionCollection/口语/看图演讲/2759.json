He is holding scissors and trying to cut something on a red plastic chair. We can safely conclude that he is playing a role play game and pretending he is doing surgery. Imaginative play or role-play games are essential for the development of children. When a child engage in pretend or imaginative play, by pretending to be different characters or by controlling objects in their own way and observing the result, they are essentially experimenting with the social and emotional roles of life. It's about learning who they are as individuals and how they fit into the world around them, how the world works, and how to walk in somebody else's shoes. They develop empathy and learn how to co-operate, to become responsible, and how to share responsibility.
