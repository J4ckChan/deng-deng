How did you decide what to buy them? What was their reaction when they received the gift, and how did the reaction make you feel?", "answer": "The last gift I bought for my best friend was a bead made of a piece of gold attached to a red knotted bracelet. I picked the gift carefully because it is for my friend's 21st birthday. She was born in Australia, so in her culture, this is the most important birthday in her entire life, that's why I picked the gold bead for her. Gold is a valuable metal that is soft but stable. It represents our friendship, long-lasting, treasuring, gentle, and bonded. And the meaning of a red knotted bracelet is an attachment to her own culture. Although she was born in Australia, she is still Chinese, and the color represents China is red, and a red knotted bracelet is a traditional Chinese decoration for good luck. She was so surprised when she received the gift and she loved it a lot. It makes me feel blithe."}, "msg": "\u8bf7\u6c42\u6210\u529f\uff01"}
