As far as I know, one of the main ways wealthy countries try to do this is with official development assistance, which is more commonly known as foreign aid. Wealthy countries transfer funds to poor countries. Or, in other cases, resources, such as food and medicine, are transported from wealthy countries to underdeveloped ones. Most of this aid is given directly from one country to another. But a substantial fraction is given through the World Bank, the United Nations, and other international agencies. Foreign aid is designed to boost poorer countries' economies, help them develop faster. However, it also comes with some disadvantages. Aid money might be directed to politically well-connected but unproductive companies or used to buy consumption goods for friends and supporters of the ruling regime, therefore generating little or no detectable effect on investment or growth.
