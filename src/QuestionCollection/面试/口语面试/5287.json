Explain your reasoning. ", "answer": "As a minimalist, I believe that people should keep only useful items, although some people might like to keep other items as well. The main reason is that becoming materialist might stop some people from improving themselves. Because whey they are too focused on getting materials, they might get lost and forget about what is the most important thing to them and forget about achieving their goals. For example, one girl is addicted to luxury bags and spends all her income on buying bags. As a result, she did not have enough money to pay for her tuition fee and had to drop out of her university. Therefore, she could not complete her degree. Her goal was to gain a degree, which she clearly has failed. "}, "msg": "\u8bf7\u6c42\u6210\u529f\uff01"}
