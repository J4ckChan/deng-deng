Some read, some exercise, and some listen to music. What do you do to reduce stress? Include specific details and examples in your answer.\"", "answer": "I reduce stress by observing the night sky. I have a computerized telescope that can see the details of the moon and even the Saturn ring clearly. Whenever I feel stressed or anxious because I have too much academic work to do, I would go out at night and watch the stars, nebulae, and planets. The night sky and the moon with a soft brightness can always heal me. The reason why I am so obsessed with observing the stars is that I loved the universe since a young age. It is so mysterious and peaceful. Hence, it is the best cure for me to release pressure and reduce stress.
