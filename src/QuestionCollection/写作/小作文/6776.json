Give specific reasons for your answer.\"", "answer": "If a foreigner were to stay in my country for just one day, I would advise this visitor to see Mount Huangshan. Mount Huangshan is a famous monument and is visited by many tourists daily. A few years ago, some tourists did not care about environmental protection; they were littered with waste paper, plastic bags and cans. In addition, they killed animals, caught birds, destroyed trees and flowers, and worse still, they often cooked on the fire in the forest, which is dangerous. Now there has been a change when the tourists leave they take the rubbish with them, they no longer hunt animals, the plants are protected and to avoid forest fires all the tourists bring their lunch. We must highly commend these good things.", "difficulty": 1, "difficultyName": "\u7b80\u5355\uff08100\u4ee5\u4e0b\uff09"}, "msg": "\u8bf7\u6c42\u6210\u529f\uff01"}
