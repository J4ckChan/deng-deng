His name is He Zheng. He was the captain of the Silk Roads' fleet in ancient China. He is very famous in China because he had brought prosperity to all neighboring countries along the Silk Roads. At the same time, his forecasting eyesight of trad had exchanged foreign goods to ancient China. So ancient Chinese could have the opportunity to consume a variety of goods from overseas.
