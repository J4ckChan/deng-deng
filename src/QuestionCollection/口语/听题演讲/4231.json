I was quite excited to get started on my work. I dressed in a suit and tie and arrived at the office 15 minutes earlier than the business time my manager told me. After my manager's arrival, he gave me three forms, including the employment contract, to go through and fill up. He then gave me a guided tour of the office and introduced me to other colleagues. Since that was the first day, my manager asked me to familiarize myself with some of the major projects he was doing. I quickly had lunch in a nearby cafeteria at noon and came back to my desk to resume work. At 5:30, everyone started to leave. I felt nice and fresh at the end of the day and would love to continue working in that environment. (148\u5b57)", "referenceText": "Describe your first day of work or school.
