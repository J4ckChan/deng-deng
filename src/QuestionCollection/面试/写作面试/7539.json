What are some measures that people take to minimize their impact? Which measures do you think work best?", "answer": "Individuals are becoming more concerned about how their actions impact the planet. Human behavior continuously affects the natural environment and causes changes in the quality of the environment, which in turn affects the normal life and health of human beings. In the relatively simple mode and small scale of production activities, human activities have little impact on the environment. Now the industrial revolution has promoted the development of human social productivity, and also affected and destroyed the human environment, especially the ecosystem. Human irrational behavior in production and life will induce or aggravate natural disasters, which can be illustrated by floods, landslides, and desertification. In order to protect the planet, some people begin to choose public transportation instead of driving private automobiles. Besides, some individuals start to donate money to environmental protection organizations. In my view, these measures are very effective to minimize the impact; for me, the measure which works best is choosing public transportation."}, "msg": "\u8bf7\u6c42\u6210\u529f\uff01"}
