Provide reasons to support your opinion.", "answer": "It is argued watching a movie based on a book can be equally good as reading the book. Everyone with regard to his private viewpoint and interests may maintain a specific direction toward this statement. Some believe that watching a movie would provide much excitement while others have a conviction that reading book before watching film gives humans deep insight in a broad sense. I am unanimous with the first group. To begin with, nobody could overlook the fact that movies are as tools which assist people to be amused. A movie which is produced with exaggerated scenes and exciting music, is able to attract a large audience. As a matter of fact, humans would employ their all imaginations in accompaniment with a movie to escape from their real life. The second reason for my argument lies the reality that directors usually display their characters briefly because they are restricted to a limited time. Watching a movie will cause the audiences to find a shallow but total understanding about a personality. It can be said that in such a great condition, when people refer to the related novel, they will confront the developed descriptions about characters and even the story; therefore, their former mentality helps them to improve their deduction power and perceive the book better.
