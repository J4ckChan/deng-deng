On the other hand, by boat, airplane, bicycle or train does not provide much the same degree of flexibility. Because I can basically use the vehicle whenever I need to as long as I own a car. However, the chance of me owning other types of traveling vehicles, such as a boat or an airplane is much less. Hence, I cannot decide when and where the transports would pick me up and drop me off. Instead, I have to follow certain schedules and timetables, which leaves me less flexibility.  On top of that, the prices of using those traveling methods tend to be more expensive. However, driving cars cost much cheaper. ", "referenceText": "Describe your favorite mode of transportation. Is it by car, boat, airplane, bicycle or train?
