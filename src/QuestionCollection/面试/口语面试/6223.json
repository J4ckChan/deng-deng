Support your opinion with personal experience and observations.", "answer": "A home means a stable foundation. When I was a little kid, my parents never had their own place. With five kids, my dad worked seven days a week, 12 hours a day; my mom worked off and on. We went from one place to another. I can remember one place we lived in had no bathroom, the windows were missing, the walls no better \u2014 there were holes in them. Sixteen years ago I started helping and will always help people in need. Now I work for the UN refugee agency. I am proud of myself and look forward to bringing those who flee their country back home."}, "msg": "\u8bf7\u6c42\u6210\u529f\uff01"}
