They seem to be in Venice which is a very beautiful city because the buildings are built on water. These are European-style buildings. This reminds me of a trip to Venice when I was in high school. I was with my family. We had a good time. It was such a memorable experience that I can immediately recall when looking at this picture. I was also on a boat when touring the city. It's so much fun as you can never experience this in other places.", "photo": "https://cdn.51ddedu.com/images/611448298925989888.jpg", "difficulty": 3, "difficultyName": "\u96be\uff08120\u4ee5\u4e0a\uff09"}, "msg": "\u8bf7\u6c42\u6210\u529f\uff01"}
