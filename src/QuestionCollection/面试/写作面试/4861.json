Explain why you would want to change it, and give an idea of how it could be changed.", "answer": "There is one thing that I wish I could change about school. It is how teachers define students' talents. Researches suggest that people show talents in many different ways. But many teachers often consider students with good academic records smart and talented, but ignore other students who show talents in other areas. As a result, these teachers tend not to create the environment for those students to further develop their interests and talents. \nTherefore, if schools could cancel exams and stop using assessments as the way of evaluating students, then more teachers would like to switch their focuses from academic performances to helping each student tap their potentials.
