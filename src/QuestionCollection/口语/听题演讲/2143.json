It was Mother's Day, I surprised my mom by giving her a bunch of flowers as a gift. I planned it beforehand and asked the delivery man to send it on that day's morning. The moment when my mom opened the door and saw the flowers, she was so surprised that she couldn't even believe what she is seeing, and she asked the delivery man twice to make sure that the flower was rightly to be received by her. She then saw the card in it, on which I wrote \"I love you, mom!\" She was so delighted and touched that I could see tears almost coming out from her eyes. She hugged me tightly for a long time, and said to me \"I love you, too.\" Both of my parents praised me on that day and made me my favourite dishes. They said to me that I am the most precious treasure in their entire lives. Since then, we were even closer and get to understand more about each other.\uff08197 \u5b57\uff09", "referenceText": "Describe a situation when you have given or received praise.", "referenceTranslate": "\u63cf\u8ff0\u4e00\u4e2a\u4f60\u7ed9\u4e88\u6216\u63a5\u53d7\u8868\u626c\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u3002", "difficulty": 2, "difficultyName": "\u4e00\u822c\uff08105~115\uff09"}, "msg": "\u8bf7\u6c42\u6210\u529f\uff01"}
