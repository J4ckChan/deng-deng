If you could only give them one food to represent your country, what would you choose and why?", "answer": "When it comes to a type of food that I would like to share with visitors coming to my home country to learn about the culture, the first thing that comes into my mind is fried rice. First of all, rice is the staple of my home country - China, while people in western countries do not usually eat rice. Therefore, it can best represent our culture. Secondly, fried rice is fried in a Chinese wok, and there is a broad range of ingredients as well as spices that you can put into the rice while frying. Therefore, fried rice can be customised to satisfy everyone's palate. (107\u5b57)"}, "msg": "\u8bf7\u6c42\u6210\u529f\uff01"}
