There are six dishes on the tray. It seems to be Asian cuisine. The waiter wears a watch on his left wrist and he is blowing a whistle. In addition, he is bold. I think he is very tired. This reminds me of my university life when I worked in a restaurant as a part-time waiter. It was extremely exhausting, but I had to do this job as I need to sustain my life in a foreign. I hope people working in difficult conditions can achieve what they want eventually.", "photo": "https://cdn.51ddedu.com/images/629515697331904512.jpg", "difficulty": 2, "difficultyName": "\u4e00\u822c\uff08105~115\uff09"}, "msg": "\u8bf7\u6c42\u6210\u529f\uff01"}
