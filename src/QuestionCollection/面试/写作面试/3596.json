What do you usually do online? What is one thing you think should change about how people use the internet?", "answer": "The controversial issue in respect of the use of the internet has drawn the public's attention and sparked a heated debate over the past decade. As far as I am concerned, having constant access to the internet indeed has brought a lot of benefits to people's lives, with the biggest one being the unrivalled convenience of communication. That is to say, by using the internet, people can now communicate with each other without any time or geographical restriction. For instance, a broad spectrum of phone applications and computer software have been invented which make instant communication available and in turn, facilitate numerous aspects of people's daily life. And this was undreamt of in the days preceding the invention of the internet. (123\u5b57)"}, "msg": "\u8bf7\u6c42\u6210\u529f\uff01"}
