Why do you dislike this food? What would you do if you were offered a lot of money to eat this food for one week?", "answer": "Let me narrate an interesting incident. It was a fine Friday morning on December 9th at my office. Our team decided to take a coffee break. So, we headed to office pantry when one other colleague, Jack, who was just this morning back from Indonesia after a week-long business trip, has also arrived. Instead of the regular coffee, he offered us a special world's most expensive coffee he bought from Indonesia. After we all drank the coffee and agreed that it tasted better than what we used to have, Jack smiled and explained the procedure of its production. We looked at each other in silence. A couple of us were about to vomit. Because we just had coffee made with half-digested coffee beans, extracted from the poop of an animal from wilds of Indonesia. Our excitement was gone, and we were thinking what we should do with what was still left in our cups. I could not dare myself to finish it, and with an apology washed it off in the sink. We were all smiling, laughing and making fun of each other's facial expressions. So, whatever you may say, I would never like to drink this thing again, not even if I was offered a lot of money to drink it for one week. (215\u5b57)"}, "msg": "\u8bf7\u6c42\u6210\u529f\uff01"}
