Which trip would you choose? Why? Give specific reasons for your answer.\"", "answer": "If I were given two choices, whether to travel to the moon for a short visit or travel to other different countries for a year, I would definitely choose to travel to the moon. Even though the trip would be so short that there will not be enough time for me to enjoy it, I can still experience the extraordinary scenery of outer space, which is totally different from earth. What's more, I could also have the chance to ride a rocket, which is going to be a lifelong experience, and I also can enjoy viewing the earth from a different angle from space. It is an unusual opportunity to travel to the moon, no matter how short the travel is, I would still cherish it for my whole life. \uff08130 \u5b57\uff09", "difficulty": 2, "difficultyName": "\u4e00\u822c\uff08105~115\uff09"}, "msg": "\u8bf7\u6c42\u6210\u529f\uff01"}
