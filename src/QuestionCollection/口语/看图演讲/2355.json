He looks a little nervous, but the coach seems excited because he is very experienced. The man is wearing a white helmet with his eyes closed tightly because of fear. The view is beautiful, and it is a pity that he missed such beautiful scenery. The fear of the unknown is the main thing that makes people feel nervous when skydiving for the first time. It's an experience, unlike any other, and you simply don't know what to expect if you haven't done it before. Some people like skydiving to being on a roller coaster. Some say it's similar to bungee jumping in the first moments. But the truth is, it's different from both of these things. It's hard to describe the sensation of looking out of the door when you're just about to jump, or freefalling through the air. The day of your first skydive will be full of new experiences. From the moment you arrive at the airfield, you'll be in a new environment with lots happening around you that you're not used to. \uff08188 \u5b57\uff09", "photo": "https://cdn.51ddedu.com/images/477110148632940544.jpg", "difficulty": 2, "difficultyName": "\u4e00\u822c\uff08105~115\uff09"}, "msg": "\u8bf7\u6c42\u6210\u529f\uff01"}
