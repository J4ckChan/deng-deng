This can take place during the semester. For example, before or after each class, teachers may give out a quiz that takes 5 minutes to complete. With the results of such a quiz, teachers can tell what has been learned well and what has not. Students can also get feedback so they can focus on their weaknesses and try to improve them. Quizzes are not final exams so they are informal and formative. This means they can be given at any time and may or may not form a part of the grade for the semester, so this flexibility gives teachers more room to adjust their teaching plan.", "referenceText": "How are quizzes useful for students and teachers?", "referenceTranslate": "\u5c0f\u8003\u5bf9\u8001\u5e08\u548c\u5b66\u751f\u6709\u4ec0\u4e48\u5e2e\u52a9?", "difficulty": 2, "difficultyName": "\u4e00\u822c\uff08105~115\uff09"}, "msg": "\u8bf7\u6c42\u6210\u529f\uff01"}
