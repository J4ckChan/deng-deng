Those toy sharks are in the color of grey and white and look quite soft. The woman has short black hair and is wearing a black short-sleeved T-shirt and a brown vest. She is placing one of her hands on the toys. I suppose she is selling the toys to the customers who come into her shop. In the background, there is a colorful painting on the wall which is composed of a tall tree and a monkey hanging over the branch. And the light overhead is turned on.
