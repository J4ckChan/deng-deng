Think about one positive behavior that you have learned from someone close to you (such as a family member, friend or co-worker). Have you adopted this behavior, and if so, how has this new behavior changed your life in a meaningful and positive way?", "answer": "My father loves reading, and I see it as a really positive behavior to broaden people's eyesight and lift ideological levels. So I adopted this behavior. It is quite useful in developing my sympathetic skills and my literacy skills. I would cry when reading a tragic novel, and feel what the protagonist is feeling while reading the book. After reading a huge amount of books, I realized that I could write fancy writing. So it was quite surprising that I could write my own story using my own language without citation, and this helped with my academic writing and the capability of expressing myself."}, "msg": "\u8bf7\u6c42\u6210\u529f\uff01"}
