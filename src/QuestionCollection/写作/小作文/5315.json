How has it changed? What has caused the change? Include specific details in your answer.\"", "answer": "Antarctica has recently experienced a significant change resulting from global warming. This is because humans are so keen on developing technology in modern society. In the past, Antarctica had pure age long glaciers and diverse creatures living on that continent. However, with the development of human civilisation, factories have emitted enormous waste gases and humans have been invading too many natural resources. These have destroyed the glaciers in Antarctica seriously. Now, penguins do not even have appropriate habitats to live in, the snow covering the continent becomes pink because of unusual microorganisms, and there exists a huge gap in the biological chain.", "difficulty": 2, "difficultyName": "\u4e00\u822c\uff08105~115\uff09"}, "msg": "\u8bf7\u6c42\u6210\u529f\uff01"}
