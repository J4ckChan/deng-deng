Personally, celebrity influence on body image and substance use is often detrimental to teen mental health. A large proportion of teenagers compare themselves to images they see of celebrities. Moreover, almost half of them said that celebrity images make them feel dissatisfied with the way they look. Therefore, appearance is among teenagers' top concerns, teen girls in particular.  Body dissatisfaction is linked to mental health challenges, including eating disorders, depression, and low self-esteem. Young women who consume media with many images of an unrealistic \"thin ideal\" are more likely to exhibit symptoms of disordered eating. Nearly half of teen girls wish they were as skinny as the models in fashion magazines. Besides, celebrities can have a leading effect on teenagers' endorsement. Hence, many influencers advertise a broad range of goods. The associated problem is that not all the goods influencers sell have been tested for their real effect, and influencers are simply reading lines and get paid by companies that hired them. And in some cases, the goods can actually have an adverse effect on teenagers' health or other aspects.\uff08215 \u5b57\uff09", "referenceText": "Some people think celebrities are not good role models for teenagers.
