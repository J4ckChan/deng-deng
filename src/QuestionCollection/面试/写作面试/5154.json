How do these activities help to prepare you for classes? How can you improve your routine to better prepare yourself for class?", "answer": "My morning routine helps me prepare for my day in school. The first thing I do in the morning is getting out of my bed and taking a shower. While I am in the shower, I normally listen to some music. This can help me wake up and become excited. After taking a shower, I will go downstairs and have breakfast with my brother and my parents. My parents would encourage my brother and me to talk about our day plans during breakfast time because they believe that it can help both of us get ready for school. There is one thing that I believe could help me improve my routine. It is adding some caffeine to my breakfast. It would get me going for the whole day. However, my parents would not allow my drink any coffee. "}, "msg": "\u8bf7\u6c42\u6210\u529f\uff01"}
