Explain the reasons for your choice.", "answer": "I would re-do the day my father drowned in the Atlantic Ocean. He had been working hard, even though we were on vacation, he was on the phone and his computer all the time. On the last day, finally he wrapped up his project. We went down to the beach to enjoy the sun and water. After a few hours on shore, we decided to go into the water to rinse the sand off. There were only a handful of people on the beach. We waded out, only up to my chest, but a huge wave washed us out to sea. There was a lot of struggle and panic, calling for help but no one could hear us. In the end, I barely made it back to shore. My father didn\u2019t make it. Starting then, I became secretly obsessed with going back in time. In short, I went kind of crazy. And deep down, it is still my dream that I could go back to that day and change it, say that I had a headache and didn\u2019t want to go to the beach, choose the beach where there was a lifeguard, choose not to go into the water but just stay on shore. Such small changes and none of the horror would have happened."}, "msg": "\u8bf7\u6c42\u6210\u529f\uff01"}
