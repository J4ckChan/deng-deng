On average, children of separated parents do just a little bit worse than children of parents in intact families. This effect is evident across multiple outcomes. For example, children of divorce do a little bit worse in educational attainment, have slightly more behavior problems, and are slightly more likely to suffer from anxiety and depression. While the average effect of parental separation is small, children of separated parents have twice the rate of serious mental health problems and substance abuse and are twice as likely to attempt suicide, as children of parents in intact families. These statistics reflect that a minority of children from separated parents have very poor adjustment. The custody of children should be determined by the court.", "options": [{"content": "What are some of the effects of divorce on children?"}, {"content": "How should the custody of children be determined?"}], "difficulty": 2, "difficultyName": "\u4e00\u822c\uff08105~115\uff09"}, "msg": "\u8bf7\u6c42\u6210\u529f\uff01"}
