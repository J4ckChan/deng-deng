Why do you think that people do not eat enough of this food? How would people benefit from eating more of it?", "answer": "I think everyone should start to eat kimchi because it is very delicious and full of nutrients. Also, because kimchi is a fermented food and has many good bacteria, it is very good for our gut. Kimchi is also cheap and very easy to make and it goes with everything. For example, sometimes at lunchtime, if I do not want to spend much money and time on lunch, I would just eat kimchi with rice and seaweed. It would normally only cost me about two dollars for the whole meal and I do not need to compromise the taste. That\u2019s why I would recommend kimchi to everyone."}, "msg": "\u8bf7\u6c42\u6210\u529f\uff01"}
