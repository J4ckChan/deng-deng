Let's talk about a reliable person I know.  This reliable person is my friend, Chloe, and she is very trustworthy. I have been stalked by two men once at Castle Towers when I was 16, and I couldn't get rid of them and I was freaking out. So, instead of calling the police, I called Chloe because I know she was nearby. She then sent her mom to pick me up and finally I got rid of the two creepy men. It is really important to be a reliable person and to have some reliable friends because once you encounter some emergencies or urgent accidents, you will always find someone to help.", "options": [{"content": "Who is this person?"}, {"content": "What are some examples of how this person is reliable?"}, {"content": "Why is it important for someone to be reliable?"}], "difficulty": 1, "difficultyName": "\u7b80\u5355\uff08100\u4ee5\u4e0b\uff09"}, "msg": "\u8bf7\u6c42\u6210\u529f\uff01"}
