For example, Fiji is a perfect destination. It has nice weather all year round as it's near the equator. It also has beautiful beaches and clear seawater. I would love to go fishing there because I have not experienced this yet and there is little opportunity to go fishing in the inland city where I live. Therefore, spending a holiday on an island such as Fiji is perfect for me.", "difficulty": 2, "difficultyName": "\u4e00\u822c\uff08105~115\uff09"}, "msg": "\u8bf7\u6c42\u6210\u529f\uff01"}
