This is because personal hygiene is an important form of self-care that will ensure that children will lead healthy life. Forming good hygiene practices from early childhood can have a positive effect on children's growth and development. Children will also learn to be independent and boost their confidence and self-esteem. This being said, schools are the best places to teach students personal hygiene as it is within the community setting that the lesson learned is put into practice. Specially designed lessons are given by teachers in a standard approach to ensure that every student fully understands them. And the peer pressure generated within the community can serve as a motive for better implementation of personal hygiene.
