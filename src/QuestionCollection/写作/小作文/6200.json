Give a few examples.\"", "answer": "Good friends bring so many colors of happiness to your life by relieving stress, giving comfort, and removing loneliness. Healthy friendships are also linked to better cardiovascular health, lower blood pressure, less depression, and a longer life. So it never hurts to try to make new friends. The first possible way to make friends is to find a local group where people with shared interests meet regularly, try a book club, religious group, parent meetup, music group, or biking group. Voluntary work is also a good platform, people who work together often form strong connections. Meet people by volunteering with a community center, charitable group, hospital, museum, or place of worship.", "difficulty": 2, "difficultyName": "\u4e00\u822c\uff08105~115\uff09"}, "msg": "\u8bf7\u6c42\u6210\u529f\uff01"}
