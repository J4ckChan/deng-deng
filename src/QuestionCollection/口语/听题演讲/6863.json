For the background music, it has to be exciting. Otherwise, people may not be excited enough to play games or ask others to dance. For food and drinks, they should be sufficient and tasty so people can enjoy the party without complaining about the food. For the venue, it needs to be neither too big nor too small as a big venue creates more distance among people while a small one might be too crowded. The people invited to join the party should be willing to socialize. Overall, there are many elements of a good party. Some of these I haven't mentioned are also crucial such as the light and the host.", "referenceText": "What are the elements of a good party?", "referenceTranslate": "\u4e00\u4e2a\u597d\u7684\u805a\u4f1a\u7684\u8981\u7d20\u662f\u4ec0\u4e48?", "difficulty": 1, "difficultyName": "\u7b80\u5355\uff08100\u4ee5\u4e0b\uff09"}, "msg": "\u8bf7\u6c42\u6210\u529f\uff01"}
