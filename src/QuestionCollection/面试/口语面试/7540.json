Although I have created various social media content and marketing campaigns in the past, the latest project is the first time I have effectively led and managed the entire staff team. This experience taught me a lot about the value of teamwork and the importance of cultivating everyone's unique talents. Although my own development of digital content and promotion plan is very satisfactory, I find it is more meaningful to lead others to complete this process together. Besides, I have also learned from the accomplishment that effective communication is crucial. Once all members have clarified their roles in the project, we can achieve higher goals. This experience has given me a deeper impact, which is my proudest achievement."}, "msg": "\u8bf7\u6c42\u6210\u529f\uff01"}
