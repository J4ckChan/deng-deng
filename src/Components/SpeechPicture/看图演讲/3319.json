The girl on the left wears a blue sweater and holds a paper facing the camera. There is a word \"DREAMS\" in capital letters and some shapes on that paper. Meanwhile, on the right side at the bottom of the paper, there are two girls and one boy drawn in red. The other girl in this picture is wearing a white hoodie and keeps the same hairstyle as the girl wearing blue. But she leans her body on the other girl and turns her back towards the camera so I cannot see her face clearly. As for the background, I can see there are whiteboards and desks with books. These two lovely girls remind me of my time studying in university, where I can share opinions and plan the future with my friends.  In conclusion, this is a very meaningful picture of two girls smiling in the classroom.
