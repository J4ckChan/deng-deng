Explain your reasoning.", "answer": "The controversial topic about standardized tests has engendered an impassioned altercation. A considerable number of people dispute that test-takers can have an unfair advantage, whereas I am predisposed to advocate that standardized tests are reasonably fair. Standardized tests examine every test-taker with the same assessment criteria, which ensures fairness. Undeniably, it is indispensable to acknowledge the significance of the code of conduct. If all test-takers can behave ethically and responsibly, then people can enjoy a healthy test environment, and the results of standardized tests can best indicate test-takers' learning outcome. Consequently, the prevailing evidence draws the conclusion that standardized tests are fair. (102\u5b57)"}, "msg": "\u8bf7\u6c42\u6210\u529f\uff01"}
