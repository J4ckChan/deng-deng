How has this activity improved your ability to complete a task? How would better concentration improve people's lives?", "answer": "I find setting a separate time to deal with worries effective for me to concentrate on my current work. Many of us have trouble concentrating during the day because we're constantly worrying about other things. It could be an approaching deadline for a project you haven't started, a new colleague who's causing problems, or just the amount of work on your desk. If you find yourself distracted by worries, then note these down so that you don't need to hold them in your mind. Then schedule a time to deal with these issues. A better concentration will help you work or live more effectively. People will feel more confident about themselves, and they are more likely to balance work and personal life.\uff08122 \u5b57\uff09"}, "msg": "\u8bf7\u6c42\u6210\u529f\uff01"}
