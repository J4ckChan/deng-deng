While art museums provide a public service by displaying artwork for the public to enjoy, they should not be free to enter. The main reason is that art museums rely on ticket sales for a significant portion of their operating budget. Free admission would mean a loss of income that would likely lead to cuts in programming and staff, which would in turn reduce the quality of the museum experience. Another reason why art museums should not be free is that it would likely lead to an increase in visitors. While this might seem like a good thing, it would put a strain on the already limited resources of most museums. Crowded conditions would make it difficult to view the artwork and enjoy the museum experience.  So I don't think museums should be accessed without pay.
