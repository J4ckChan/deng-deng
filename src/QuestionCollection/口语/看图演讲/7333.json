The right one is golden blond, in a seemingly yellow dress, and looking straight into her mobile phone. Beside is a large shopping bag painted with tomatoes and some words as well. So she is probably waiting for a train instead of an airplane. In the middle sits a black woman, also focusing on her precious phone. There is nothing else can be seen since it is a black-and-white picture, apart from a white plastic bag or handbag hanging on her forearms. The left is a short-hair woman with a quite straight sitting posture. I guess she may be a soldier on her mission, with a large black bag packed with guns or something like that.
