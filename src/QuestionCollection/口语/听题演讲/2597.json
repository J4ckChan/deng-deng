Anyway, talking about participating in a competition, I took part in one about seven years ago from now when I still was a high school student. It was the time of the annual sporting event, and I took part in a friendly volleyball match. The game started between the two teams which included both the senior and junior students of my school in both the teams. The first four sets of the game were drawn, but the final set was really competitive as both teams tried their best to score points. I also tried my best to return the ball over the net when it had come on my way, but unfortunately, I had failed to return the ball on a few occasions. As a result, my opponent team had a little edge over my team. The game had continued like this for some more time, with everybody trying to hit and punch the ball over the net on the opposite side of the court, and I was getting tired. Suddenly, another \"serve\" came on our way, which, we thought, was going to fall outside of the court, but my whole team was proved wrong. A little later, my opponent team was declared the winner. I felt really great about the completion, even though I was on the losing side because it made me feel competitive. I also felt really good, when my fellow team members were cheering me and encouraging me to play well because it made me really confident about my ability. \uff08296 \u5b57\uff09", "referenceText": "Describe a competition you are part of or that you watched.", "referenceTranslate": "\u63cf\u8ff0\u4e00\u573a\u4f60\u53c2\u52a0\u8fc7\u6216\u770b\u8fc7\u7684\u6bd4\u8d5b\u3002", "difficulty": 2, "difficultyName": "\u4e00\u822c\uff08105~115\uff09"}, "msg": "\u8bf7\u6c42\u6210\u529f\uff01"}
