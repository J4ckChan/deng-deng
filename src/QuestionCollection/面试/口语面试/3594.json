Explain why it's important to you now.", "answer": "Having a job or a career is now of crucial importance to me. But it wasn't important to me 5 years ago because I was still a full-time student then. First of all, I get paid for work. If I can earn money, I can buy things I need, pay my bills, have a place to live, and basically do things I want to do. Without money, I can't do much. Besides, having a job or career makes me feel good. Knowing that I can do something well and earn money for my skills is a great feeling. And when I work, I develop new skills, learn new things, and create a record of employment. Last but not least, having a job or a career comes with self-respect, dignity, and self-worth. I am being responsible and making sure that I can take care of myself. I am creating a solid foundation that I can build on to have a successful future.
