What are the benefits and drawbacks to this advance?", "answer": "In my city, the latest technological progress is online living payment. It has changed the way people in my city work, live or communicate. Some people think that this progress will make people lazy, but we have to admit that it has brought more convenience to people's lives. Before, people had to go to the business hall to pay for living expenses, such as water and electricity. This wastes a lot of time and queuing makes it inefficient. In recent years, with the development of the network, the online payment function has been improved. Everyone can use their mobile phones to complete online payment after work and study. It not only saves time, but also saves payment records."}, "msg": "\u8bf7\u6c42\u6210\u529f\uff01"}
