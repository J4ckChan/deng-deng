When I do not have classes, I try to spend my time with ease and relaxation so that I can get refreshed and recharged. On one such day, I get up late from sleep and cook myself a decent brunch which is usually made up of scrambled eggs, fresh tomatoes, slices of bacon, and toasts. I then go to the supermarket to purchase some necessities that I am short of at home. After I get home, I do my laundry and clean up my room. Then I watch movies or TV serials till 5 and cook dinner with the fresh ingredients I just bought. Sometimes, I hang around with my friends. Hanging with friends, watching movies, listening to music, cleaning and cooking is the main enjoyment I have during my typical free days. Such a day is quite different from my other typical days as I do not need to get up early, go to university, attend lectures or write assignments. Such days are critically important for me because I can get relieved from the monotonous routines and scheduled life.
