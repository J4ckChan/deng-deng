Explain your reasons for your opinion.", "answer": "I don\u2019t think people can be truly selfless. We, as humans, never do anything unless it is good for what we care about. If you care about the little starving children, you might spend a lot of money to help them, but ultimately it is because your brain does so, and rewards you (itself) in some way for it. You will never, and I mean never, take action that hurts your goals. That is not how brains work. We might call people who donate to charity selfless, but they do it because they want to, and because they gain from it (in emotional or other non-monetary way).\uff08109 \u5b57\uff09"}, "msg": "\u8bf7\u6c42\u6210\u529f\uff01"}
