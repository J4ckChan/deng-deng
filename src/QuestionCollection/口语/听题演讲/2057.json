To stem the tide of rural depopulation, I believe that we must first address its root causes. At the heart of the matter is the disparity between services and facilities in the country and those in the city. I believe that urban and rural dwellers alike would find the idea of country life far more appealing, if high quality libraries and schools were more readily available in the country. One further method of attracting people to the country would be for the government to provide financial incentives to professional teachers and trainers who willingly relocate to rural areas.
