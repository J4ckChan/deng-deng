In primary school, we had the opportunity to pick up one sport as extra-curriculum activity. Influenced by my father, who is an amateur player, I chose table tennis and practiced playing it at least twice a week. After primary school, I still keep playing table tennis with my family and friends on weekends. One of my friends even became a professional player and won the medal in the national games. Since table tennis is one of the most popular sports in China, the table can be easily found in parks and community clubs. To learn how to play table tennis, I highly suggest you learn from the basic skills first, such as bumping the ball, because it can help you to build up advanced skills on a solid foundation.
