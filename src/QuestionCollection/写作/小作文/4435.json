Give specific reasons for your answer.\"", "answer": "The controversial topic about teamwork has engendered an impassioned altercation. A considerable number of people dispute that independent work has a number of advantages over teamwork, whereas I am predisposed to advocate that working in a team is better than working independently. Undeniably, it is indispensable to acknowledge the significance of collaboration. If people all work individually on every task, then work efficiency would drop to a record low. Since strengths vary from one person to another, it is highly recommended that work be assigned to different team members according to their specialties. Consequently, the prevailing evidence undoubtedly draws the conclusion that working with a team is preferable to working independently.
