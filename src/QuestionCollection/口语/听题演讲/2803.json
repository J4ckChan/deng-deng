When a family member or a friend is dealing with a tough time, it's not always easy to know how to support them. Sometimes, it can be hard to know if your friends or relatives are going through a rough patch or whether there might be more severe issues like anxiety or depression. You may notice that they are not hanging out with their friends as much or are always tired and feeling down. They may be snappier or perhaps look a mess. When you notice these changes, check-in with them to see if they're OK. Sitting and quietly listening is the next step. Don't rush to offer advice. Let them know you are there for them and that you want to help where you can. If they don't want to talk about it, respect that. Let them know you are worried and that you are happy to listen when they want to talk, or suggest other people. By listening and responding in a non-judgmental and reassuring manner, you are helping in a significant way.
