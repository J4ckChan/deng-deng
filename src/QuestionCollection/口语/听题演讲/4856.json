One night when I was about 7 years old, I went with my mum to her friend's house. Her friend prepared many desserts to welcome me and my mum. I started with one cake and after I finished the second slice, my mum tried to stop me but it did not work. I was being naughty and trying to eat all the cakes on the table. I ended up in hospital that night and regretted having too many desserts. ", "referenceText": "Describe a naughty thing you did when you were a child.
