Who taught you this, and how did you thank them for it? How will you use this knowledge to help you in the future?", "answer": "The last thing I learnt that made me wiser is punctuality. I used to be a person who would always be late for meetings and appointments. This bad habit caused me lots of troubles as people gradually distrusted me. Last month, my boyfriend told me that I need to be punctual enough if I want to grasp good work and study opportunities. He also made a timetable to remind me of the deadline of my works. In the future, I will use the knowledge of punctuality to my work and provide my employers and customers with a positive impression. (99\u5b57)"}, "msg": "\u8bf7\u6c42\u6210\u529f\uff01"}
