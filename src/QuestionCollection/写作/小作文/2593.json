What does it look like? Why is it special? Give a few reasons.\"", "answer": "There is a ring I would wear every day, which is my wedding ring. The ring itself is in the color of yellow, which is made of pure gold. The shape of the ring is like the math symbol \"infinity\" that represents our love and marriage will last forever. What's more, it also has a lot of diamonds around it that makes it very shiny. It is very special to me not only because of its shape and meaning but also because the initials of my husband and me are crafted on the back of the ring, as well as the date of our marriage which is the ninth of September. In Chinese, it also has the meaning of a long-lasting relationship. It is this special wedding ring that I cherish very much. \uff08133 \u5b57\uff09", "difficulty": 1, "difficultyName": "\u7b80\u5355\uff08100\u4ee5\u4e0b\uff09"}, "msg": "\u8bf7\u6c42\u6210\u529f\uff01"}
