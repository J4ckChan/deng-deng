Why do you think they would choose these? How do these qualities affect your friendships?", "answer": "When it comes to three qualities that I think my friends would say I have, I suppose they would pick kindness, trustworthiness, and attention to detail. This is because I am genuinely friendly, generous, and considerate. Being kind often requires courage and strength. Kindness is an interpersonal skill. It usually involves devoting resources to others, rather than be self-interested, which means having more and more for myself. As a result, kindness actually brings lasting well-being for me. I am a man of my word. I don't talk much but when I do it carries unparalleled weights. Every time I am assigned a task, I will make sure every single detail is up to required standard. Therefore, my friends can always trust me to get things done beautifully. Also, I always keep an eye on details, and I am active when I see friends in need. After being helped, my friends will appreciate my kindness, show me respect, and probably return the favour later when I need a hand. By helping others, I get a sense of fulfillment, and the relationship is reinforced.\uff08182 \u5b57\uff09"}, "msg": "\u8bf7\u6c42\u6210\u529f\uff01"}
