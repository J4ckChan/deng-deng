To me, he is a hero, an ideal father, a benevolent person, and a man of honor. He is around 75 years old now. We live in a joint family, and he is still the head of our family. Though he can\u2019t manage every aspect of our family due to his age, yet he is still the decision-maker for our family. I remember him from my early childhood when he used to play chess with me. He taught me many things, including the value of honesty and punctuality. He told me some of his great adventures in his life through stories, and those stories are still inspiring for me. He is a person of his word. He would not talk much, but when he does, it carries unparalleled weights. He is a benevolent person, as I have seen him helping many people in our locality. He was an educated person and a successful father, as all of them are successful professionals and businessmen now. I revere my grandparents for his acute observation and significant decisions. I like him so much that I want to become a person like him.\uff08200 \u5b57\uff09", "referenceText": "Describe an older person that you admire. How long have you known them?
