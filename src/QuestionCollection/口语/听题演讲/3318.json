Firstly, it is always good to show up bringing a gift for the host and it should be a thoughtful item that I know the host can use. About the time of arrival, 10 to 15 minutes before the designated time on the invitation is considered appropriate. When I arrive, I will gently inquire about how things are done to avoid any misunderstandings. For example, whether I should take my shoes off or which area is private that guests are not supposed to enter. When having dinner, instead of staring at the mobile phone screens, I would spend more time participating in the conversation. Finally, at the time when I am about to leave, I will express my gratefulness to the host again and maybe send them a thank-you message when I arrive home. The basic but most important principle that I should bear in my mind is always keeping polite.
