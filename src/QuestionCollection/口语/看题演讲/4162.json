Both of them can eat a lot. While Alan hates doing exercises, William is a stocky guy who likes hitting the gym to keep fit, so he is quite muscular. Both of them are quite funny and can make me laugh a lot, which means hanging out with them is always pleasant. Alan is pretty good at cooking and has invited me over for dinner several times. On the other hand, William rarely cooks at home but enjoys dining out, so it is always a good idea to ask him where to get the best food. Despite their different characteristics, it is possible to have different kinds of friends - each unique in their own ways.
