Homeless people live in the harshest conditions, without anything. They are subject to horrific violence, discrimination, criminalization, and stigmatization, with life expectancies far lower than the housed population. It is the government's responsibility to deal with the issue of homelessness. To begin with, governments must make an immediate and bold shift. They will need to embrace human rights and adopt rights-based housing strategies. A human rights framework has the capacity to recognize that homelessness is a matter of life, death, and dignity. At the same time, its central aim is to protect vulnerable populations against inequality and the conditions that breed inequality. Governments can prevent more people from becoming homeless. It must enable people to access accommodation by increasing rent supplement to match market rents, introducing tax breaks for landlords, so it is feasible for them to lease properties; and providing greater security for tenants by regulating rents.
