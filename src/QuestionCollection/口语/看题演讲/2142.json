During this period, I was rather busy as I had to complete my final year project while getting ready for the final year exam simultaneously. On the very first day, I realized that I had to make a proper timetable for both works. Otherwise, it would be highly likely that I lose either a final year project or exam, which both were equally important for completing my degree. Though I spent a few hours making that plan it was really helpful for me to manage both tasks without getting too stressed. Even though I had a plan and timetable for my work, I had to work 15-18 hours per day with few hours' sleep. Some days I felt that I was going to suffer from shock or even die of tiredness. But after having a short interval of break - a hot shower usually served the purpose - I was able to reduce my stress down to a certain level, and eventually, I went through those bleakest times throughout the course. \uff08192 \u5b57\uff09", "options": [{"content": "When was this?"}, {"content": "What all were you doing?"}, {"content": "How did you manage your time?"}], "difficulty": 2, "difficultyName": "\u4e00\u822c\uff08105~115\uff09"}, "msg": "\u8bf7\u6c42\u6210\u529f\uff01"}
