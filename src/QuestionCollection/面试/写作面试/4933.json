What made you to want to read it again?", "answer": "On writing, a memoir of the craft is a book written by Stephen King. One quote from this book is \"I am writing the first draft of this part at my desk on a snowy morning in December of 1997.\u201d The first time when I read the quote, it touched my heart on a very deep level. Perhaps, it was because of his sincerity. I read this book more than one time because of Stephen King\u2019s belief. It provides me with spiritual support. Stephen King believes that writing is a lonely job and having someone who believes in him makes a lot of differences. Writings are speechless, but believers of words would always get connected to the literature."}, "msg": "\u8bf7\u6c42\u6210\u529f\uff01"}
