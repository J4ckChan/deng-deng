Do you agree or disagree? Provide support from your personal experience and/or observation to support your opinion.", "answer": "Yes, someone can always be convinced by facts. However, the facts must be strong enough to be able to convince. In a debate, audiences would always be convinced by the side with stronger evidence. Even their opposite would partially agree with opinions from their side. That is also why there is always a win and a loss in a debate. Moreover, in a relationship, sometimes couples need to make decisions together. However, individuals might have different choices. And at this time, someone would make concessions, and this person is usually convinced by his or her partner because their partners have a stronger point of view."}, "msg": "\u8bf7\u6c42\u6210\u529f\uff01"}
