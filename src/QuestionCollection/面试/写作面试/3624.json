Explain your reasoning.", "answer": "People nowadays tend to look up to famous people very much due to various reasons. In my opinion, the first and foremost reason is that celebrities have one or more traits that average people desire deeply, ranging from attractive appearance, luxury lifestyle to strong capability. People admire, idolize and worship celebrities, because they consider the latter as important, powerful or famous, and because a great number of people know about the latter. Celebrities appear on the media, which allows people to peek into their lives. They seem to live a different and more interesting lifestyle than average people, or so the media makes the public think. There is a subconscious desire in the human race to idolize anything that seems better, greater, richer, well known or powerful. There is a tendency to worship anything that seems glamorous, fascinating or powerful. People all want to live a different and better life, and reading about celebrities, watching them on TV, or following them on Instagram and other social networks, makes average people feel that that they are participating and taking part in celebrities' glory. Just so average people feel closer to celebrities, as if celebrities are their friends, and this gives them a good feeling. (203\u5b57)"}, "msg": "\u8bf7\u6c42\u6210\u529f\uff01"}
