Do you think it is important to spend time with your family? How can spending time together benefit family relationships?", "answer": "Teens tend to have much energy to get out, so going out to play basketball or tennis with the whole family must be fun. The family where teenagers grow up has a big influence on how he or she deals with relationships, copes with situations, and learns about living life. Family time is also important because if children don't get the required attentions, they might do things that could get them into troubles. There's an old saying that goes: families that play together, stay together. We all know that the quality time with our family is paramount in building stronger relationships. Building forts, sharing stories, and just being together makes a difference in all of our lives. Family bonding time builds confidence, teaches children about interacting with others, and create wonderful memories that last a lifetime. The children whose parents spent time with them did far better in school than those whose parents spent their off-work hours pursuing their own hobbies. Plus, parents may discover it's really fun and relaxing to play games, read books, and build forts with their kids!\uff08181 \u5b57\uff09"}, "msg": "\u8bf7\u6c42\u6210\u529f\uff01"}
