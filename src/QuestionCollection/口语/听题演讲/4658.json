GM foods can also allow for reductions in food prices through improved yields and reliability. It is estimated that the world will have to grow 70% more food by 2050 just to keep up with population growth. Climate change will make much of the world's arable land more difficult to farm. GM crops could produce higher yields, grow in dry and salty land, withstand high and low temperatures, and tolerate insects, disease, and herbicides. On the other hand, the main concerns around GMOs involve allergies, cancer, and environmental issues \u2014 all of which may affect the consumer.
