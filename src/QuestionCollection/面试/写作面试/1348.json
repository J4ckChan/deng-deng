Explain your reasons for your opinion.", "answer": "Some people believe that a few people can be truly selfless while I rather hold the realistic view that it is almost impossible to be truly selfless. Before discussing this issue, we must reach a consensus on the meaning of the word \u201cselfless,\u201d which puts others\u2019 interest before self-interest. Then, if a person always disregards self-interest, he will instantly find himself on the brink of death as there is nothing left for himself. For example, a person may give up his life for saving someone else, and such a move can be regarded as selfless. However, it is impossible for him to always be selfless throughout his life. In conclusion, people can be selfless, but cannot always be truly selfless because there is no such real condition for him to give out everything.\uff08136 \u5b57\uff09"}, "msg": "\u8bf7\u6c42\u6210\u529f\uff01"}
