Why or why not?", "answer": "It is commonly acknowledged that it should always be teachers' goal to minimize subjectivity and assumptions. They have to prevent their emotions, opinions, and ideas that are not a part of the teaching from influencing their equality. As far as I am concerned, achieving an emotionless state of objectivity while teaching can be incredibly challenging. One of the biggest adversaries of objectivity is human emotion. And emotion can either be triggered by teachers' own experience or the behaviour of students. From the anger evoked by being stuck in the traffic jam on the way to school to the frustration generated when struggling to persuade a naughty student to behave. This emotional connection can make it difficult to teach every single student objectively. I believe that education is not, and cannot ever be, just the transmission of facts, knowledge and skills. Therefore, it's not possible for teachers to be 100% objective in their teaching."}, "msg": "\u8bf7\u6c42\u6210\u529f\uff01"}
