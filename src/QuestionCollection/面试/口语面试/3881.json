Explain how the book has influenced you.", "answer": "When it comes to the book that has influenced me the most, the first one that jumps into my mind is the Harry Potter series written by J.K. Rowling. Despite his strong magic, Harry Potter is a true hero as he is willing to stand up for people who are in need. This quality is what I have always been aiming at. Harry has always been on the side of protecting vulnerable group and justice. For example, if someone is bullied, then he will correct what is wrong by using the magic to appropriately punish the protagonist. It is Harry's bravery of protecting disadvantaged people and doing justice that inspires me. Although it is impossible for me to have magic, my ambition will never change. And in order to stand up for people who I love, I will continue to pursue strength and whatever it takes to live a secure and happy life. (153\u5b57)"}, "msg": "\u8bf7\u6c42\u6210\u529f\uff01"}
