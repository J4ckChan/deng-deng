When we finally set our foot on the snow mountain, we were amazed by the gorgeous nature presented to us. Before attending the skiing class, I was worried that I could learn a new skill only in a couple of hours. To everyone's surprise, despite the fact that it was literally my first attempt at skiing, I picked it up rather quickly. After finishing the class, I was free to go on my own. I was then taught by my friends how to turn while keeping going, and again, I learned quickly. After that, my friends and I went around and around on the harder track, and we all had great fun.
