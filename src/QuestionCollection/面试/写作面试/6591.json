Do you agree or disagree? Provide support from your personal experience and/or observation to support your opinion.", "answer": "I agree that taxes should be applied to unhealthy foods. Taxes on sugary soft drinks have been implemented in many places. In the UK, the Soft Drinks Industry Levy (commonly known as the \u2018sugar tax\u2019), which was introduced in March 2018, adds a charge of between 18p and 24p per litre on drinks depending on the quantity of sugar that they contain. These types of taxes have been effective at reducing the consumption of sugary soft drinks and at encouraging firms to reformulate and reduce the amount of sugar in the drinks they produce. This suggests that broader taxes that increase the prices of other types of unhealthy food could be effective tools for tackling obesity, although their ultimate success will depend on how consumers and firms respond to their introduction."}, "msg": "\u8bf7\u6c42\u6210\u529f\uff01"}
