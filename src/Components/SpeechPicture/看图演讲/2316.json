A dandelion is a small wild plant with a soft white ball of seeds that can be easily blown away for propagation. The little girl is holding a dandelion in her hand and blowing its seeds. The girl has curly blonde hair, wears a white hoody. She looks rather cute. She is in the middle of a plant field that is dominated by green. This picture is beautifully taken, presenting us with an impressive view where the little girl and nature are in perfect harmony. \uff08104 \u5b57\uff09", "photo": "https://cdn.51ddedu.com/images/477110144337973248.jpg", "difficulty": 1, "difficultyName": "\u7b80\u5355\uff08100\u4ee5\u4e0b\uff09"}, "msg": "\u8bf7\u6c42\u6210\u529f\uff01"}
