In front of him, there are two pots and one wok placed upside down on the ground. It seems that he is trying to use the chopstick and the shovel to knock on the pots to make some sound, just like beating a drum. In addition, we can tell from his facial expression that he is very concentrated on this, which may indicate that he is very fond of novelty music and maybe he is a musician who is trying to find some new ideas for his music. In the background, we can see some cabinets and a dishwasher, so we can assume that the man is sitting in his kitchen and trying to have a \"kitchen concert\".\uff08153\u5b57\uff09", "photo": "https://cdn.51ddedu.com/images/477110191582613504.jpg", "difficulty": 2, "difficultyName": "\u4e00\u822c\uff08105~115\uff09"}, "msg": "\u8bf7\u6c42\u6210\u529f\uff01"}
