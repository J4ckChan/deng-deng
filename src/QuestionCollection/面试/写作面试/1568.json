How did you get the courage to try it? What did you learn from this experience that will help you in life?", "answer": "I had an essay from my school, which asked us to find an early childhood center and observe its environment and how the educators treat children. It was a tough job for me because I had to convince the director of the early childhood center that what I did will not harm the children and will actually help the teachers there improve their performance. I first sought some advice from my teacher and had great communication with my classmates. These helped me a lot. This experience was meaningful. I learned that whenever you want to try something new, it will be better to talk with someone with more experience. \uff08109 \u5b57\uff09"}, "msg": "\u8bf7\u6c42\u6210\u529f\uff01"}
