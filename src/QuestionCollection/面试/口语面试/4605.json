Explain your reasoning.", "answer": "The most important thing I have learned from my parents is the value of hard work. They taught me that nothing worth having ever comes easily. I've seen the reward they've received by being persistent through the hard times. As a family with two children, my parents have always been hard-working and set an excellent model for me. Although they are far from perfect, I watched them sacrifice incredibly to give myself and my younger brother the best opportunities they could. In terms of what they could have done better, I have suggested my father that he needs to think twice and discuss with my mother before making any big decision as my mother tend to consider things a lot more thoroughly than my father. Another reason is that communication is one of the best ways to maintain a healthy relationship. I strongly believe that the lessons I have learned from my parents are going to be greatly beneficial to my future life. (163\u5b57)"}, "msg": "\u8bf7\u6c42\u6210\u529f\uff01"}
