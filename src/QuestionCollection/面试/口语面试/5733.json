Discuss what type of team or group it was (such as sports, acting, community service). What is something that you learned from that team or group?", "answer": "The last time that I worked in a team in university was 1 year ago. I really enjoyed working with the all team members within that team. The project that our team was working on was about the relationship between music and the regeneration and repair of neurons. Although the topic seemed very complex, we made a great achievement as a team. I think there are a few reasons why our team succeeded.  Firstly, our team leader was in his last year in medical school, and his professional knowledge and experiences were a great help to the whole team. Secondly, the strategies that this leader set out for the whole team helped each member cooperate in an effective and efficient way. Thirdly, we had great communications within the team, which was critical for the team to deliver and perform. I think that great leadership skills and effective communications are important in teamwork. "}, "msg": "\u8bf7\u6c42\u6210\u529f\uff01"}
