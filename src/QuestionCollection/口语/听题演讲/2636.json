Personally speaking, surfing the internet is very convenient, and it is my favorite form of media. The internet is not just a place to find information. You can use it to chat with your family and friends through social networks, such as Facebook, Twitter, or WeChat, and many other options available on the internet, which let you stay closer with others than ever before. Checking in with regular video chats or sharing photos online is a great way to stay connected when you can't be together in person. The internet has been a great discovery in recent years, and nearly everyone is using it, especially young generations. Young people who are interested in music, writing, or art can find loads of useful resources and ways to practice online. From starting a blog to following your favorite artists on Instagram, the internet can be an excellent way for young aspiring creatives to get started. \uff08183 \u5b57\uff09", "referenceText": "What is your favorite form of media?
