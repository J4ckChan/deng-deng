The vision is blurred by a giant bubble in the foreground. This bubble is reflecting different colors, which are the 7 colors of the rainbow. The principles behind this view are to do with the broad spectrum of light, which I happened to have learned in my physics class back in high school. No doubt, it is amazingly beautiful. This kind of bubble is probably generated by blowing off the soap-water mixture from a circular shape of a toy. I remember playing with one of those toys when I was young. It really was interesting. In the background, I can see an adult man who wears a cap, a long-sleeve shirt, and a pair of bright color pants. He is the most outstanding person in the background because he is the tallest among all the other people. And down the bottom right corner, there is a little boy who is probably very young as can be told by his height. \uff08181 \u5b57\uff09", "photo": "https://cdn.51ddedu.com/images/477110152927907841.jpg", "difficulty": 3, "difficultyName": "\u96be\uff08120\u4ee5\u4e0a\uff09"}, "msg": "\u8bf7\u6c42\u6210\u529f\uff01"}
