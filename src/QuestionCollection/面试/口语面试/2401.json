Explain your reasons for your preference.", "answer": "I will read both fiction and non-fiction, but I much prefer fiction; probably 90% of the books I read are fiction. When I read non-fiction, it's rarely for entertainment value. Usually, I'm hoping to get several useful ideas to implement in my work or in my life. As such, I'm constantly having to monitor what I'm reading with a critical eye; in contrast to the way the question is phrased, just because something is non-fiction doesn't mean that it's real. There are some non-fiction books that I do read for entertainment value; Mary Roach's Stiff: The Curious Lives of Human Cadavers comes to mind. Fiction is mostly for entertainment, even though I often want to be challenged by the material. When a fictional text is challenging, it provides me with insight into the human condition that I didn't have before. \uff08140 \u5b57\uff09"}, "msg": "\u8bf7\u6c42\u6210\u529f\uff01"}
