Why would you like people to remember you for this? How would being known for this benefit you?", "answer": "As a young chef, I want people, such as chefs and customers, to remember my cooking skill. Although I am still being trained, I had practiced my cooking skill for many years before I decided to be a chef as my career. Working as a chef, the experience is much more important than qualification. To gain experience requires a chef to work from the bottom level in the kitchen before handling the dishes. Moreover, as a chef, it is important for customers and the head chef to remember me, not for my personality but for the dishes that I have cooked and served. It is only the good taste and good cooking skill that I want people to remember. One of the benefits that being known for my cooking skill is that it allows me to get into a higher-level position in the kitchen so that I can learn more, think more, practice more and train more for my other skills. Once I have been graded satisfaction for my skills, I can have the opportunity to work in a higher-level restaurant, and the head chef of the restaurant I work for is willing to write me a recommendation letter for it. Once I am relatively reputable, I also can have the opportunity to work as Michelin 3-star Chef.\uff08218 \u5b57\uff09"}, "msg": "\u8bf7\u6c42\u6210\u529f\uff01"}
