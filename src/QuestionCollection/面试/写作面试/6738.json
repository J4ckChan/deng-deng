What are some ways that you have grown or changed from the time when you first started going to school until now? What experiences in your education do you feel have most strongly impacted your worldview? How so?", "answer": "When it comes to the topic of formal education being a transformative experience, I would assert by instinct that I have grown or changed from the time when I first started going to school until now. There are also some experiences in my education that I feel have most strongly impacted my worldview. Formal education taught me how to be a decent man. I learned how to show my respect and listen to what other people have to say. In addition, I learned critical thinking and logical thinking through formal education. The experiences of learning critical thinking and logical thinking helped me get a better understanding of the world should be viewed."}, "msg": "\u8bf7\u6c42\u6210\u529f\uff01"}
