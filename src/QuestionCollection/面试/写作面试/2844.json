Explain how you overcame problems in order to master the skill", "answer": "One of the difficult skills I have learned is self-examination. It is the toughest skill to learn because it requires brutal honesty with yourself. A level of honesty you might not be accustomed to. A level you might only be able to attain seeing a therapist or a life coach. Humans are natural learners\u2014and we learn best when we perform the tasks we're trying to learn. No matter how good our grades were at college, most of our learning takes place once we enter the workplace and start applying what we have learned. In order to master this skill, the first thing I do is to know my nature and nurture is the best gift you can offer yourself and others. It is the treasure you are looking for in the quest for truly knowing your strengths, weaknesses, and when you're lying to others and yourself. If you don't know yourself, you might be lying to everyone (including you) without even being aware of it, and it might cause important problems in your life. \uff08175 \u5b57\uff09"}, "msg": "\u8bf7\u6c42\u6210\u529f\uff01"}
