What do they say or do that models kindness? What have you learned from him or her?", "answer": "The person who is very kind toward others is my grandfather. To me, he is a hero, an ideal father, a benevolent person and a man of his honour. He is around 75 years old now. We live in a joint family and he is still the head of our family. Though he can\u2019t manage every aspect of our family due to his age, yet he is still the decision-maker for our family, and every single decision he has ever made involves a great level of kindness towards every other person. I remember him from my early childhood when he used to play chess with me. He taught me many things including the value of kindness. He told me some of his great adventures in his life through stories and those stories are still inspiring for me. He is a person of his word. He would not talk much but when he does it carries unparallel weights. He is a benevolent person as I have seen him helping many people in our locality. We never take his kindness for granted, instead, we very much appreciate all the things he has done for us. I revere my grandfather for his acute observation and great decisions. I like him so much that I want to become a person like him. (218\u5b57)"}, "msg": "\u8bf7\u6c42\u6210\u529f\uff01"}
