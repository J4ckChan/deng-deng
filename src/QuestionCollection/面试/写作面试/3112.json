Provide reasons for why you think the way you do.", "answer": "As far as I am concerned, the group is more important than the individual. Firstly, if everybody takes are about just one person, the resources for the rest will be limited. Let's say that you are in a community and you get shot. The amount of medicine is limited and there are many people who have minor injuries. If every resource is used for you exclusively, the other people that have minor injuries will not be cured, therefore even if you are saved, there will be other people whose injury will get worse. That is why the group is more important than just one individual. Secondly, in a community, there will be people who cannot keep up as well as others. In an intermediate math class, for example, there are 20 students. 8 are top students who never need help. 11 are intermediate students that sometimes need help. Then there is 1 student that has no idea what he is doing and needs help all the time. So, the teacher has to spend all the time with the 1 student whilst the other 11 students also need help. The obvious thing to do is to put that 1 student who is not qualified enough to be in the intermediate class into the beginner's group. Not only for the good of the community but also for his own good. Sometimes, it is good for the community to compromise the person that obstructs the vision of the future, but at the same time, it is also god for the person to have gone out.
