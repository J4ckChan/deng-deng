Why is this activity fun for you? How can this activity benefit you or others?", "answer": "During my free time, I usually take some exercise and I enjoy it very much. It is fun for me because physical exercise is important for both physical and mental health. Taking a half hour after work or on the weekend can get my blood pumping, get the endorphins flowing, and revitalize spirit. I can build muscle, burn calories, and oxygenate the brain--giving me a release after a day of stress. Exercising regularly also helps me remain disciplined, which can be valuable in a demanding work environment, and can reduce the long-term effects of stress as well, meaning regular exercisers tend to be less stressed about their jobs. And on top of that, I will also look better and feel better, which gives me greater confidence towards my body figure.\uff08130\u5b57\uff09"}, "msg": "\u8bf7\u6c42\u6210\u529f\uff01"}
