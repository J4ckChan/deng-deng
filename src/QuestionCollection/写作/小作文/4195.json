Which do you prefer? Why? Give specific reasons for your answer.\"", "answer": "I think spending one's whole life living in the same place is kind of boring, but it also indicates steadiness, which means one can maintain his or her social circle and develop a long-term relationship. While moving around throughout one's life because of work, education, or adventure could be quite a cool experience, it can also be quite challenging, especially when the household is big. A single adult person can go anywhere he likes, or anywhere he should be needed, but kids may not be able to cope with the changing environment. Therefore, I prefer to live in the same place throughout my life. (104\u5b57)", "difficulty": 1, "difficultyName": "\u7b80\u5355\uff08100\u4ee5\u4e0b\uff09"}, "msg": "\u8bf7\u6c42\u6210\u529f\uff01"}
