The health effects of air pollution are serious \u2013 one-third of deaths from stroke, lung cancer, and heart disease are due to air pollution. This is having an equivalent effect to smoking tobacco. Air pollution is hard to escape. It is all around us. Microscopic pollutants in the air can slip past our body's defenses, penetrating deep into our respiratory and circulatory systems, damaging our lungs, heart, and brain. As well as affecting our health, pollutants in the air are also causing long-term environmental damage by driving climate change, itself a major threat to health and well-being. In order to control air pollution, it is strongly recommended that the government should develop affordable strategies to reduce emissions from energy, transport, waste management, housing, and industrial sectors.
