To be a good friend, one needs to be there for late-night talks or tears. The number one goal should be to offer support. Just knowing someone is willing to listen or offer advice or care can make all of the difference to a friend going through hardship. Call, text, or write and just ask, \"How are you? Is there anything you need or that I can do?\" Even if they say they want to be alone, at least make the offer. However, you should not force them to talk when they are not ready to do so. Give them the space they ask for, then reach out again. Several times. Don't run away. Sometimes people aren't sure what to say when a friend is going through a hardship, so they say nothing or distance. This could hurt your friend more.
