Would you prefer to start by copying the style of well-known artists or would you prefer the freedom to be creative and see what happens? Why is this your preference?", "answer": "Suppose I had to choose an art class like painting for fun. I'd much instead start by copying a well-known artist's style, rather than being free to be creative right from the start. Emulating the styles and works of famous artists is a solid foundation for painting. If you want to do anything well, you must start with imitation at the very beginning. After imitation, you will become proficient and form your style and innovative works. This is not something to be rushed. At the same time, by studying the works of well-known artists, my interest in painting will be deepened, and it will also help me persist in this hobby. \uff08112 words\uff09"}, "msg": "\u8bf7\u6c42\u6210\u529f\uff01"}
