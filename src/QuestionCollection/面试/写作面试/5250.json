Provide reasons to support your opinion.", "answer": "Although some people believe that social media has more negative impacts on people\u2019s lives, I personally believe that social media does more goods than harm and it can help people achieve their goals. The main reason is that people can broaden their social circle on social media, which leads to a higher chance for them to achieve their personal goals. For example, my friend Peter was trying to sell more cosmetic products through the Internet. He reached out to some influencers on Instagram and made a pretty good deal with them. So, these influencers started to promote his cosmetic brand to their fans. As a result, he achieved his sales target. It approves that people can do great things with the help of social media.
