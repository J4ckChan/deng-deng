Who was with you at the party and what did you do there? What is your favorite memory from this party?", "answer": "I have attended many parties on different occasions but the most memorable one was a party that I held to mark my elder sister's twenty-fifth birthday. It was a surprise party that I planned with the help of my mother. It was on the twenty-fifth of September last year, and I had started to plan it a week ahead. After my sister left for work in the morning, I started decorating our house and installing the setup. My mother started baking the birthday cake and cooking. I had also contacted all my sister's close friends and our relatives beforehand and asked them to come to our place before 6, which was the time my sister finished work. The celebration commenced at the very moment my sister stepped into the house while we surprised her by pulling the crackers. She was literally frightened but was soon overwhelmed by happiness. We then socialized and enjoyed an incredible dinner. I am sure everyone had an amazing time at the party. (167\u5b57)"}, "msg": "\u8bf7\u6c42\u6210\u529f\uff01"}
