Provide reasons to support your opinion.", "answer": "Many people believe that people in the entertainment industry are overpaid. I agree with the statement since other occupations are more important and vital for human beings. I believe all biological scientists like pharmacists and biochemists in our society should be paid more because they immerse themselves in laboratories working night after night to discover novel ideas and create innovative techniques. On the other hand, the job of movie stars or pop singers is to entertain the public and not categorize them as vital jobs. Therefore, I do not think they should be highly paid.
