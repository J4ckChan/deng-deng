It was extremely difficult as one of our group members did not work hard enough to get his part done, and other members' parts depend on his part. We decided to report this issue to the teacher and eventually, we managed to complete it because we reassigned the tasks to each member. It was a nightmare working with someone who would not cooperate. Therefore, I learned from this experience that I need to be determined to kick out someone in the group who is lagging behind.", "referenceText": "Talk about a difficult assignment you had in school, and how you completed it.", "referenceTranslate": "\u8c08\u8c08\u4f60\u5728\u5b66\u6821\u5b8c\u6210\u7684\u4e00\u9879\u56f0\u96be\u7684\u4f5c\u4e1a\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u4f60\u662f\u5982\u4f55\u5b8c\u6210\u7684\u3002", "difficulty": 2, "difficultyName": "\u4e00\u822c\uff08105~115\uff09"}, "msg": "\u8bf7\u6c42\u6210\u529f\uff01"}
