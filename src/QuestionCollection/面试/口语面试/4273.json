What is enjoyable about this activity? How could it be improved?", "answer": "One of the most enjoyable school activities is the Peer Network program. The program is designed to let senior university students help new students during orientation weeks. Members of the group all wear orange T-shirts. They get elected and trained to serve others more professionally. The volunteer activities involve showing new students the way to their destinations on the campus, answering their questions relating to course enrolment, university life and so forth. I was elected to be one of the Peer Networkers, and I enjoyed the activity very much because I got the opportunity to develop my communication and interpersonal skills, extend my social network. More importantly, I got a sense of achievement by helping others. I suppose rather than gathering in the home building, Peer Networkers can be distributed across the entire campus in order to get more exposure and help more students in need.
