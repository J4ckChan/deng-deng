Do you agree or disagree? Provide support from your personal experience and/or observation to support your opinion.", "answer": "Cell phones are an invaluable technology that has fundamentally changed the way we communicate and get information. But as with anything good, too much of it can lead to problems. I agree that too much screen time can affect family relationships. A growing body of research is highlighting the various drawbacks of overusing cell phones and other mobile devices, including\u2014ironically\u2014the fact that all this communication technology is actually pulling us farther apart and negatively affecting our interpersonal relationships. One increasingly-talked-about downside to constantly being attached to a cell phone is phubbing, or \"phone snubbing,\" a trend that is unfortunately on the rise. Therefore, I think that people need to be aware of this, so they don't lose their relationships with those who are most important to them."}, "msg": "\u8bf7\u6c42\u6210\u529f\uff01"}
