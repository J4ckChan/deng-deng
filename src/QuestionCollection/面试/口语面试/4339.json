Why or why not?", "answer": "When it comes to whether the jury should consider any difficulties in the accused person's life during the trial, people's notions vary from one another. As far as I am concerned, difficulties in life should be taken into consideration. It is commonly acknowledged that every adult possesses a certain level of knowledge of rules and understands the difference between right and wrong, and hence they would not commit a serious crime unless there is a strong driver. That is to say, if a person is being treated fairly by others, there would be no trigger for killing. I can imagine that the serious crime must be committed as the last and least-wanted measure by the accused person because the situation left him or her with no other options. That person must be so desperate to break out from the difficulties he or she was experiencing. To conclude, I believe that the jury should consider the difficulties in life that the accused person has experienced during the trial. (167\u5b57)"}, "msg": "\u8bf7\u6c42\u6210\u529f\uff01"}
