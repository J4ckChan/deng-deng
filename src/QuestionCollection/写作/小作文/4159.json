Why? Give specific reasons for your answer.\"", "answer": "When it comes to one thing that I could change about my high school, the first thing that springs to my mind is the school canteen. It is understandable that school canteens have an important role to play in providing healthy food and multiple drink choices for students. Nonetheless, more focus should be placed on the taste of the food they provide. This is because if students do not like the so-called healthy meals in school canteens, they will dump the meals into bins, which increased the problem of food waste. Instead, they will buy snacks and instant noodles, which is unhealthier. Therefore, I very much would like to change the school canteen at my high school.
