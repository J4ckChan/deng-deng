Firstly, some people are in pursuit of beauty, and getting plastic surgery is an effective way for them to improve their facial appearances. For example, one lady was not happy about her facial structure and wished to get her eye-brow reconstructed. After undergoing a 5 hours surgery, she got a new pair of eye-brows, which, in her definition, was an enhancement for her look. Secondly, some criminals might wish to get surgery for their whole faces because they do not want the police force to recognize them as criminals.
