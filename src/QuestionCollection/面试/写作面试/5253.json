What did you like most about this place? How could the place be improved for the people who visit there? ", "answer": "I visited a Korean barbeque place with my friends last Saturday. It is a buffet and it costs 45 dollars per head. It was such a lovely experience! My friends and I were very satisfied with their food and their services. The most thing that I enjoyed about this place was the food that is served. The beef was super fresh and it had an unlimited amount of sushi and ice cream. Although we were pretty happy about this place, there was something that I wish they could improve in the future. It is their ventilation system. All bbq lovers know that when you barbeque meats, there will be smoke coming out. So did that restaurant. I would be much appreciated if they can think of an alternative way to keep the air fresh in the house."}, "msg": "\u8bf7\u6c42\u6210\u529f\uff01"}
