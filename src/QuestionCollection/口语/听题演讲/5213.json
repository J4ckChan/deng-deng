Firstly, some countries, such as North Korea, can train some people and make them become spies. After these specially trained spies are sent to other countries, they are capable of obtaining high-security level confidential information. For example, spies from North Korea could obtain information about how to make a rocket from other countries. This highly confidential information could help scientists in North Korea produce rockets. As a result, the military power of North Korea could be strengthened. Secondly, some spies only work domestically to protect the local citizens. For example, MI5 in the UK is a national security department in the UK. Many spies work for this organization. One main purpose of this organization is to protect the UK against threats to national security.", "referenceText": "Do you believe spies are necessary?
