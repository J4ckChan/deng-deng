Why do so many students study abroad? Include specific reasons.\"", "answer": "Nowadays, more and more people choose to go abroad for further study. From my perspective, there are several solid reasons why people are studying abroad. One of the biggest reasons for studying abroad for many international students is that they can be immersed in a totally different environment. This enriching experience will enable them to see and do things they wouldn\u2019t expect and meet people who have grown up in a different culture. Moreover, becoming an international student can significantly broaden their study options. For example, the UK, USA, and Australia all have highly regarded higher education systems and a huge percentage of the world\u2019s most top-ranking universities. To sum up, more people choose to study overseas because of the fantastic benefits mentioned above. \uff08124 \u5b57\uff09", "difficulty": 3, "difficultyName": "\u96be\uff08120\u4ee5\u4e0a\uff09"}, "msg": "\u8bf7\u6c42\u6210\u529f\uff01"}
