Is it the most important thing, or are there other aspects of education that are more important?", "answer": "Making learning an interesting thing is an effective way of engaging students to study. People are easily attracted by things they think are fun, and this would help generate intrinsic initiative in studying and learning. So, making studies fun could effectively trigger the motivation for students to study. They are willing to study instead of being forced to study. Hence, this method would lead to a faster and more solid result of the study."}, "msg": "\u8bf7\u6c42\u6210\u529f\uff01"}
