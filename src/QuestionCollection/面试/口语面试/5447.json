I believe in the future far from now, humans would be able to figure out the principle and the mechanism of the universe. I really eager to know the truth about the universe, this is because when I was super small, my dad would always read stories for me. And I loved to listen to anything about the universe such as nebula, supernova, planets, the aether, the solar system, and the earth. My childhood experience triggered all my curiosity about the universe. I still remember back in that time I was asking my dad \"do you know the truth of the universe?\", and my dad told me \"no, no one really understands the universe, but in the future, we human beings may figure it out someday. But at that time, I would be dead and you might also be dead\". So, if I have any chance to know the principle of the universe in advance, I would give anything as an exchange."}, "msg": "\u8bf7\u6c42\u6210\u529f\uff01"}
