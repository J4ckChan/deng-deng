How would doing this improve your community? Why is it important for young people to do things that benefit the environment?", "answer": "Young people can do a lot of things to help the environment. These include planting trees, saving paper, limiting the use of air conditioners, stopping using deodorant and aerosol sprays, using less glass when designing buildings, conserving electricity, saving water where possible, driving less, and walking more, carpooling, and using less plastic. Doing these things can improve the community by disseminating a message that protecting the environment should be the responsibility of everyone. It is important for young people to do things that benefit the environment because the future belongs to young people and the sooner they develop good habits to protect the environment, the better they can continue to help make a better world."}, "msg": "\u8bf7\u6c42\u6210\u529f\uff01"}
