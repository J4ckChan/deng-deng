My school provided many chances for us to participate in social justice activities, and I enjoyed partaking in that whenever I could. I helped to organize a fundraiser for the homeless. I was named the team captain and was responsible for recruiting participants and overseeing others' work in maintaining the budget, booking the venue, creating the itinerary, and promoting the event. It was extremely challenging and stressful as well, but very rewarding. We ended up raising $22,000. I think this experience is rewarding because I get the opportunity to help others, which is meaningful. As the saying goes: \"The more we give, the happier we feel.\" Volunteering increases self-confidence. You are doing good for others and the community, which provides a natural sense of accomplishment. Your role as a volunteer can also give you a sense of pride and identity.
