Explain your reasoning.", "answer": "We all feel taken advantage of from time to time. Perhaps you did not get the right haircut on your last visit to the salon, or your last restaurant meal was mediocre. Maybe a friend is taking you for granted, or a neighbor is continually asking for favors. Feeling taken advantage of implies a feeling of injustice or inequality. As a person who is quick to help or listen, I am often taken advantage of. I use to be upset about it, but now I find I'd rather be taken advantage of than taking advantage of someone else. One of the most important factors is that I want someone to love me because I can always offer help. I like the feeling when someone turns me for help, and I will feel proud of myself whenever I can help them figure out the problems. Moreover, it will make me feel guilty if I take advantage of others.\uff08157 \u5b57\uff09"}, "msg": "\u8bf7\u6c42\u6210\u529f\uff01"}
