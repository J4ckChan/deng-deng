Do you agree or disagree? Why? Give specific reasons for your answer.\"", "answer": "When it comes to the grades of assignments and exams, people's notions vary from one another. As far as I am concerned, it is necessary to give marks to school assignments and exams in order to encourage students' learning. It is commonly acknowledged that grades help students better see how well they have learned. If a mark is too low, it indicates the need for harder work or possibly a change of learning method, which can encourage them to put more effort into study. And a good grade can also promote learning since students who have got good grades will probably want to keep receiving compliments from teachers and parents. Due to the reasons outlined above, we can safely draw the conclusion that school assignments and exams should be graded because grades encourage students to learn.
