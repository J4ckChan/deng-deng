Actually, there is a lot more to be taken into account before saying \"no\" to candidates who have previous convictions in order to avoid discrimination. Like many other areas of discrimination, the issue of the criminal record involves a careful balancing of different rights. Employers can only refuse the candidate in cases where a person with a particular criminal record poses an unacceptably high risk if he or she is employed in a particular position. In general, employers should consider the following when examining a criminal background check: Firstly, how much time has passed since the crime was committed? Secondly, was the candidate a minor when the crime occurred? Thirdly, was the crime a serious or repeat offense? And lastly, is the crime somehow related to the job? For instance, someone who had committed stealing maybe shouldn't be hired for positions relating to cash.
