Provide reasons to support your opinion.", "answer": "Parents never have the right to post photos and videos of their children on social media if their children are grown enough and their appearance is already identifiable. The reason is that a parent does not own his or her children. Their children have their own personalities, their own decision on privacy. So, only if the parents get permission from their children, then they are able to post the photos online. Or else, children's privacy should be protected."}, "msg": "\u8bf7\u6c42\u6210\u529f\uff01"}
