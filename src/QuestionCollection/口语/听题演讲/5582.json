For example, legislation and law are comparatively absolute authorities in human societies. Most people behave under the regulation of laws, and that is how laws can protect citizens most of the time. However, sometimes gap exists. For example, if a person is under 14, then he or she is protected under the children's protection law. If this child murders another person, then he or she does not need to be charged for criminal obligations. Clearly, this is unreasonable. So under this circumstance, citizens should challenge the authority and challenge the absence of the law in this area, and push to cover those gaps.", "referenceText": "Is it ever acceptable to challenge authority?
