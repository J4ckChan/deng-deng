Provide reasons to support your answer.", "answer": "Technology usage has skyrocketed over the past decade. People have reached the point as a society where there's less argument about whether tech addiction is real; whether we're spending too much time on digital devices. The conversation has shifted to what all of us - tech companies, parents keeping their children's tech use in check, and each user individually - should do about it. Too much screen time might interfere with opportunities to gain greater benefits that experiencing a larger variety of activities offers. When it comes to recreational screen time for kids and teens, I would say 1-2 hours on school days is a reasonable amount. On weekends and holidays, perhaps 3-4 hours of recreational screen time is a reasonable amount. On the other hand, for adults, as much of the work today involves the use of technology, I would say 6 hours per day for average workers and 8 to 10 hours per day for workers in the IT industry. This being said, any further usage of technology will be deemed as too much. (175\u5b57)"}, "msg": "\u8bf7\u6c42\u6210\u529f\uff01"}
