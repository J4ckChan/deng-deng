Explain the reasons for your opinion. ", "answer": "There is one thing that I do not agree with, it is the negligence of parenting. I grew up in a family of an alcoholic father and an irresponsible mother. My traumatic family experiences have caused many serious issues since my childhood. Therefore, I strongly disagree with these irresponsible parenting ways from my biological parents. They were not good examples of parents. Later on, I was adopted by an Australian couple and they became my guardians. My life was completely changed. They believe that parents or caregivers must provide unconditional love and care for their children so that children will have a better chance of forming positive relationships with families, friends and others.
