The real challenge lies in how I respond once I catch someone in the act. The moment when I learned that my best friend Jack lied to me about the fact that he was going abroad to further his study, he was already on the plane to America. We promised to go to the same university and go into the same company with each other forever. I read the text message his mother sent to me again and again, and I couldn't believe that was happening. Till the very last minute, he didn't dare to tell me the truth himself. I was overwhelmed with sadness and happiness at the same time. I was upset obviously because my bestie was going to leave me. I was definitely going to miss him very much. Without Jack, there would be no one to hang out with. I was glad because he was going to pursue a brighter prospect. That lie broke our relationship. We have never been contacted since then. I learned that friends should always be honest with each other since a healthy relationship hinges on trust, and a lie can easily destroy that bond.
