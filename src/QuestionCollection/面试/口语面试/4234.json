Explain your reasoning.", "answer": "The foods we eat, the air we breathe, the water we drink and the climate that makes our planet habitable all come from nature. To care for ourselves we must care for nature. I think we should cherish our planet. And I would make Earth Day a real holiday celebrated by everyone in the world. On Earth Day, both children and adults take the day off to volunteer for earth-saving activities. There shall be no parades or fireworks, and cities and towns spend the money on educational programs and environmental mitigation. Families gather together over an organic meal, talking about what they can do differently to help save the earth. On Earth Day evening, everyone turns off their lights for two hours in the name of saving energy. (128\u5b57)"}, "msg": "\u8bf7\u6c42\u6210\u529f\uff01"}
