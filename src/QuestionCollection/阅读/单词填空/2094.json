Azerbaijan's diverse landscape affects the ways air masses enter the country. The Greater Caucasus protects the country from direct influences of cold air masses coming from the north. That leads to the formation of subtropical climate on most foothills and plains of the country. Meanwhile, plains and foothills are characterized by high solar radiation rates.", "answer": "\u963f\u585e\u62dc\u7586\u6c14\u5019\u7684\u5f62\u6210\u53d7\u5317\u6b27\u53cd\u6c14\u65cb\u3001\u897f\u4f2f\u5229\u4e9a\u53cd\u6c14\u65cb\u548c\u4e2d\u4e9a\u53cd\u6c14\u65cb\u7684\u5317\u6781\u51b7\u6c14\u56e2\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u5c24\u4e3a\u660e\u663e\u3002\u963f\u585e\u62dc\u7586\u591a\u6837\u7684\u5730\u5f62\u5f71\u54cd\u4e86\u6c14\u56e2\u8fdb\u5165\u8fd9\u4e2a\u56fd\u5bb6\u7684\u65b9\u5f0f\u3002\u5927\u9ad8\u52a0\u7d22\u5730\u533a\u4fdd\u62a4\u4e86\u8fd9\u4e2a\u56fd\u5bb6\u514d\u53d7\u6765\u81ea\u5317\u65b9\u7684\u51b7\u7a7a\u6c14\u56e2\u7684\u76f4\u63a5\u5f71\u54cd\u3002\u8fd9\u5bfc\u81f4\u4e86\u4e9a\u70ed\u5e26\u6c14\u5019\u7684\u5f62\u6210\uff0c\u5728\u5927\u591a\u6570\u4e18\u9675\u5730\u5e26\u548c\u5e73\u539f\u7684\u56fd\u5bb6\u3002\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u5e73\u539f\u548c\u4e18\u9675\u5730\u5e26\u7684\u592a\u9633\u8f90\u5c04\u7387\u4e5f\u5f88\u9ad8\u3002", "options": [{"letterSize": 3, "word": "diverse"}, {"letterSize": 3, "word": "affects"}, {"letterSize": 2, "word": "ways"}, {"letterSize": 3, "word": "masses"}, {"letterSize": 1, "word": "the"}, {"letterSize": 4, "word": "protects"}, {"letterSize": 3, "word": "country"}, {"letterSize": 3, "word": "direct"}, {"letterSize": 1, "word": "of"}, {"letterSize": 1, "word": "air"}, {"letterSize": 3, "word": "coming"}, {"letterSize": 1, "word": "the"}, {"letterSize": 2, "word": "leads"}, {"letterSize": 1, "word": "the"}, {"letterSize": 1, "word": "of"}, {"letterSize": 3, "word": "climate"}, {"letterSize": 2, "word": "most"}, {"letterSize": 1, "word": "and"}, {"letterSize": 1, "word": "of"}, {"letterSize": 3, "word": "country"}]}, "msg": "\u8bf7\u6c42\u6210\u529f\uff01"}
