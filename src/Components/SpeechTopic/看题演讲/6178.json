I can remember many such events from my childhood, and among those, I would like to talk about my first attempt to climb a big tree to find the nest of a bird. I was around 8 or 9 years old at that time. With two other kids, I went to play near a big garden one day. Suddenly, I noticed that a bird was chattering at the top of a tree, and we assumed that it was a mother bird whose nest would have some colorful eggs. We got curious about it, and I decided to climb the tree to inspect it myself. The tree was huge, and it was dangerous for me to climb on top of it. But I was so excited and mesmerized that I forgot the danger. That was a very adventurous thing to do for me in my childhood and I did it out of the inquisitiveness that a child usually feels about new things.", "options": [{"content": "How old were you?"}, {"content": "What did you do and why?"}, {"content": "How did people react to it?"}], "difficulty": 1, "difficultyName": "\u7b80\u5355\uff08100\u4ee5\u4e0b\uff09"}, "msg": "\u8bf7\u6c42\u6210\u529f\uff01"}
