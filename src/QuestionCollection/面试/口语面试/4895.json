What made him or her such a good teacher? What is one lesson your teacher taught that you will never forget?", "answer": "The most effective teacher that I have met was a lady named Sally. She was one of my lecturers when I was doing my master's degree in university. Her successful ingredients include good time management and professionalism. Her excellent time management skills enable her to manage hundreds of students and provide scaffolded support to each student, as well as help students achieve their goals. Moreover, she behaves extremes professionally in class. For example, one student had an argument with her during one class and her high professional teaching standard allowed her to deal with the situation in an excellent way and with calm. As a result, many students claimed that they really appreciated the way how Sally dealt with the situation. Personally, I will never forget that lesson. "}, "msg": "\u8bf7\u6c42\u6210\u529f\uff01"}
