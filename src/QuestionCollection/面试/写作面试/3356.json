Why do you think that subject is valuable for every student?", "answer": "From my point of view, coding is the subject that not required by schools but is necessary for all current students. Since students are heavily relying on computers for study, basic coding can enable them to understand how to use the software efficiently. When they graduate and work, they still need to use computers no matter what their occupation are. Even with further study, they may develop the software specifically for their profession. Looking into the future, almost all the cutting edge of technology is relevant to computer science, so building up interest and knowledge in schools is important for students to follow the trend.
