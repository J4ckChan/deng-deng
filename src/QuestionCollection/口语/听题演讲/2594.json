There are a few steps that you can do to prepare for a picnic. Firstly, take some fruit. During summer, fresh fruits and vegetables are plentiful. They are also really good for you! Fruits and vegetables are naturally low-calorie, and a guilt-free way to bulk up your meals. They also contain lots of antioxidants and fiber, which aids in digestion. Fruits can include watermelon, apples, strawberries, and green beans. Fill up your picnic basket with a colorful fruit salad paired with vanilla yogurt dip. Secondly, add a dash of activity. To work up an appetite, incorporate physical activity into your day in the great outdoors. Physical activity not only can protect against weight gain, but it also lowers the health-related risks associated with obesity and abdominal obesity. Toss a Frisbee, throw a football, or play a rousing game of bocce. It is fun and good for you. Last but not least, keep the food safe. Prepping, packing, and transporting food to a picnic should be done carefully. Giving your date food poisoning is not a great look. There are tips on how to keep your food safe when you don't have a refrigerator or freezer available, such as putting cold food in a cooler with ice or frozen gel packs or keeping your cooler at 40\u00b0F or below to prevent bacterial growth. \uff08240 \u5b57\uff09", "referenceText": "What should you do to prepare for a picnic\uff1f", "referenceTranslate": "\u4f60\u5e94\u8be5\u4e3a\u91ce\u9910\u505a\u4e9b\u4ec0\u4e48\u51c6\u5907\uff1f", "difficulty": 2, "difficultyName": "\u4e00\u822c\uff08105~115\uff09"}, "msg": "\u8bf7\u6c42\u6210\u529f\uff01"}
