What do you think this dream means? Would you hope this dream comes true? Why or why not?", "answer": "I had quite a strange dream just a couple of days ago. I was going on a trip to Thailand for holiday until I had to change my plan before getting aboard. It was indicative to me, but I could not understand the meaning until later. It turned out to be a sign of my negligence in my studies. I had been dreaming about the school holidays rather than concentrating on my study. Later, I started catching up with my schoolwork. I believe that my dream was my subconscious mind telling me to improve my academic performance, otherwise there was no holiday for me. I hope this kind of dream will never come true because no one wants his holiday to be spoiled at the last minute. (127 \u5b57)"}, "msg": "\u8bf7\u6c42\u6210\u529f\uff01"}
