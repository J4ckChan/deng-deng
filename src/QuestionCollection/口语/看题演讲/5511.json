Some people might have too much time to kill, and when they feel bored, they might begin to daydream. Other people might find it hard to achieve some of their goals in real life. Therefore, doing daydreaming becomes a way for those people to get comfort after they choose to compromise with reality. For example, a patient could be daydreaming about getting fully covered and healthy, while an inspired singer to be could be dreaming about becoming a popular singer one day. However, although daydreaming can bring people comfort, it might lead to some negativities too. For example, if a young adult, who sets up a plan for himself to become a CEO of a famous technology firm, never implements his plan and does nothing but keeps daydreaming every day, sooner or later, he would have to realize that by just doing daydreaming, his dream will never come true.
