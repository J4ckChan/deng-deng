What did you like most about the main character? How could the story have been improved?", "answer": "The last story I remember reading is the Harry Potter series written by J.K. Rowling. Despite his strong magic, Harry Potter is a true hero as he is willing to stand up for people who are in need. This quality is what I have always been aiming at. Harry has always been on the side of protecting vulnerable group and justice. For example, if someone is bullied, then he will correct what is wrong by using the magic to appropriately punish the protagonist. It is Harry's bravery of protecting disadvantaged people and doing justice that inspires me. In terms of how the story could have been improved, I suppose a large proportion of readers would love to see that Dumbledore, Harry's teacher, could have somehow been brought back to life after the greatest villain, Voldemort, had been killed. This would definitely make it a happier ending. (146\u5b57)"}, "msg": "\u8bf7\u6c42\u6210\u529f\uff01"}
