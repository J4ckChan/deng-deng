Others believe it should only be available to the best students. What do you believe? Why? Give specific reasons for your answer.\"", "answer": "As far as I am concerned, tertiary education should be available to all students. To begin with, making tertiary education available to all students could encourage more people to upskill through tertiary study, which will, in turn, enhance their potential in a job market that is increasingly requiring degrees from prospective candidates. Additionally, today's tertiary students face several potential financial burdens that weren't experienced by past generations, such as inflated house prices and cuts to penalty rates. Offering free tertiary education would combat this issue, allowing students to undertake further study without facing a huge financial burden. To sum up, I believe that college or university education should be available to all students.
