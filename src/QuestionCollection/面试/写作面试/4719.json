How did that experience affect the friendnship? What did you learn from the experience?", "answer": "When it comes to a time that I disappointed a friend, the first thing that jumps into my mind is the decision I made when selecting universities. My friend and I had agreed and promised each other that we choose the same university so that we can go to school together again. But at last, I had chosen a university far away from our initial school, and my friend was so disappointed in me that she stopped talking to me and our friendship had come to an end that we no longer as good friends anymore. The last thing she told me is that she felt cheated as I broke our promise and if she could go back in time, she doesn't want to be my friend as I cannot keep my promise. From this experience, I have learned that promises cannot be set easily if you cannot keep it. (150\u5b57)"}, "msg": "\u8bf7\u6c42\u6210\u529f\uff01"}
