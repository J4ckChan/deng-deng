How did the person react to your surprise? How did it impact your relationship with that person?", "answer": "I surprised my mother by giving her a bunch of flowers as a gift on Mother's Day. I planned it beforehand and asked the postman to send it on that day. My mother was surprised and happy when she opened the door and saw the flowers and the card in it. She cried a little bit because she was moved by my grateful words on the card. I said thank you for bringing me up and taking care of me whenever I need, I love you, Mom. Since then, we are even closer to each other and understand more about each other. It was a great surprise that I brought to my mother's life, and a great connection was built up since then. And I believe Mother's Day is the most important day in a year when all of us who can still be with our mother cherish the time with them. (152 \u5b57)"}, "msg": "\u8bf7\u6c42\u6210\u529f\uff01"}
