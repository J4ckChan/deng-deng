Give specific reasons for your answer.\"", "answer": "Nowadays there are lots of statues and monuments to honor people in cities which can remind us to feel grateful for what they may have done to our country and society. In China, many personalities come to my mind, such as chairmen Mao, Deng, and Xi. If I had to decide whom would be my city build, I would choose Xi Jinping. This essay will further discuss reasons to support my choice. His life needs to be known to understand why he is the perfect famous person for our statue or monument. He is the president of China and he led China to become one of the world's superpowers, which shows how brilliant he is even during many international crises such as the Taiwan question. Therefore, I would recommend the city build a statue for Chairman Xi.", "difficulty": 3, "difficultyName": "\u96be\uff08120\u4ee5\u4e0a\uff09"}, "msg": "\u8bf7\u6c42\u6210\u529f\uff01"}
