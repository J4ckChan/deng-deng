How do your experiences with your family members affect you? What is one thing that you contribute to your family that is helpful for them?", "answer": "I was pretty much blessed in every way to have the most supportive, loving, understanding parents. In China, parents usually make it an unwritten rule that their kids get involved in one activity or job whether the kids want to or not. But my parents encouraged me to follow my own dreams and supported me 200% on the way. When I was only seven, I was already super interested in music, but my family wasn't that rich. My mom enrolled me in piano lessons and eventually found an affordable piano to have at home. My parents went to every single music event and supported me. This inspired me to follow my dreams. Their hard work contributed not only to a comfortable home, solid healthy meals on the table day in day out, clothes, cars, extracurricular expenses, etc. I thank them by learning really hard, and eventually got excellent grades in every subject learnt at school, which made my parents genuinely proud of me. And now, because of my proficiency in piano, I can play a piece of music to welcome every guest who comes to my place and help them better enjoy the stay.
