She has got blonde hair and wears a yellow T-shirt which has some English words on it. The little girl's facial expression tells me that she is in amazement because her eyes and mouth are wide open, and she is raising one of her hands up to the front of her face, with 2 fingers doing a sort of gesture that indicates the length or size of a particular thing, probably the thing she has just seen. In the background, there is a tall adult in a black coat walking, and a couple of other kids sitting near a huge tree trunk. I suppose they are having an excursion. \uff08126 \u5b57\uff09", "photo": "https://cdn.51ddedu.com/images/477110140043005952.jpg", "difficulty": 1, "difficultyName": "\u7b80\u5355\uff08100\u4ee5\u4e0b\uff09"}, "msg": "\u8bf7\u6c42\u6210\u529f\uff01"}
