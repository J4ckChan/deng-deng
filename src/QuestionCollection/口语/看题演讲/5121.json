For example, we have fruit crops, vegetable crops, nut crops, spices crops, and grain crops. I would like to talk about how Indian people grow crops. Firstly, grain crops seeds should be planted in the Spring or Autumn. Secondly, we need to get the soil well prepared. Thirdly, we need to water the soil. Finally, we need to wait and see how they grow. India exports different types of crops to other countries, including grain crops.
