Why does this need to change? How would your change help the people who live there?", "answer": "If I were the leader of my country, I would like very much to see my country free of corruption. Having lived in my country where corruption has become deeply rooted in all kinds of organizations, both governmental and non-governmental, I'm really frustrated. Corruption has been accepted as a normal practice in people's day to day life. People with great power are supposed to use the power sensibly and serve civilians well. However, they are increasingly using the power to fulfill their own desire and can be easily bribed, which can usually be detrimental to civilians and the country. If my change could be realized, my country would be better off in many ways. For instance, all funding would be distributed to the designated areas to optimize the outcome, and there would be much less injustice. (136\u5b57)"}, "msg": "\u8bf7\u6c42\u6210\u529f\uff01"}
