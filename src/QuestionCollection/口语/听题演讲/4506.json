The reason why I want to talk about it is that it is such a unique and important aptitude for me. Before I fully understand the importance of empathy, I used to think that empathy was useless and could make me feel very emotional. That is why I haven't paid too much attention to it and never thought it was my talent before. However, as I grew up, I finally found the beauty of empathy. I realize that I'm gradually becoming a good listener and a conversationalist because of my strong empathy. I can fully understand my friends' and family members' agony and anxiety and effectively comfort them with appropriate wordings. Empathy enables me to better comprehend other people's feelings and thoughts. Thus, I often keep positive relationships with the people around me. That's why I want to talk about empathy.
