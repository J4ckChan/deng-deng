Provide reasons to support your opinion.", "answer": "Although some people might argue that it is not our responsibility to help a stranger get out of trouble, in my opinion, if we see someone who might need some support we should help them. The main reasoning behind this is that we should show empathy to people who need help and thus try our best to help them. Take my own experience as an example. I saw a father and a son walking in the rain without an umbrella. I had an extra umbrella in my car, so I stopped and offered my umbrella to them. They accepted my offer. 2 days later, my umbrella and a thank-you card were delivered to my door. The card was sent by the father and the son who took my umbrella. They were grateful for what I did.
