Listen first, talk second is a good communication rule to apply to every interaction, especially as a manager. You want to know your employees well enough to know what kind of criticism they respond to and what kind of personalities they work best. Listening is a critical element of understanding your team members. Another way is to encourage collaboration. Create a culture that says \"we complement each other\". This will in turn result in mutual respect for each other's skills and work. When your employees respect each other, the words 'conflict resolution' might never enter your managerial vocabulary. Respect is a yellow brick road to effectively solving disagreements.", "referenceText": "In what ways can people who work together avoid serious conflict?", "referenceTranslate": "\u5728\u4e00\u8d77\u5de5\u4f5c\u7684\u4eba\u600e\u6837\u624d\u80fd\u907f\u514d\u4e25\u91cd\u7684\u51b2\u7a81\uff1f", "difficulty": 3, "difficultyName": "\u96be\uff08120\u4ee5\u4e0a\uff09"}, "msg": "\u8bf7\u6c42\u6210\u529f\uff01"}
