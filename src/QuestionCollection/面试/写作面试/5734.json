Explain your reasoning.", "answer": "Although some people recognize the importance of making enough money to live comfortably, I personally believe that it is critical for people to do work that they are passionate about. There are two main reasons. Firstly, doing work that we enjoy is for the sake of our mental health. If we need to spend 8 hours a day, 5 days a week working, and if we are absolutely passionate about what we do, not only can we have financial security, we can also enjoy what we do and keep our minds healthy. Secondly, it is for the sake of innovation and development. For example, if a medical researcher does not like her job, she might be reluctant to find breakthrough medical treatments which could potentially benefit millions of patients. As a result, less contribution to society will be done. "}, "msg": "\u8bf7\u6c42\u6210\u529f\uff01"}
