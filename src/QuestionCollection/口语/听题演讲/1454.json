I am softer looking than my mother and harder-edged in personality. I am less stubborn than my father, but I have cheekbones and a prominent chin. I have my mother\u2019s hair color, my father\u2019s skin color. I have a nose that looks somewhere between the two. I am of average height. I am not tiny and skinny like my mom. I am not tall like my dad. I am not overweight like my aunts on my father\u2019s side. I escaped the worst of the mental illness on my mother\u2019s side. I inherited my father\u2019s chronic kidney stones. I do not know how it works. I think genetics are weird. (130 words)", "referenceText": "Whom do you most resemble in your family?
