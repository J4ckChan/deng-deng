Why do you prefer one over the others? What are some advantages and disadvantages of each option?", "answer": "I prefer sitting on a chair while studying. This is the most comfortable posture for me to implement during a long-time of studying. It is the most scientific way to study because sitting on a chair can keep my spine up straight, and I can stay sitting on a chair for a long time without tiredness. Standing is too exhausting, your knees have to bear the pressure of all your weight from your upper body. And if you stay seated on the ground for a long time, you have to bend your knees, and this will result in tiredness again. Plus, it is bad for your eyesight because you have to study at a low angle.
