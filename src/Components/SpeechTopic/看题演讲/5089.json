Studying online attempts to use the technology and connect people without the barriers of distances. By studying online, students can save time from going to and going back from school and can have more flexibility to arrange times. In addition, studying online would provide students with more autonomy to practice the capability of self-study. However, there do exist some drawbacks. Attending classes is a part of the learning process. Learning never means learning by someone's self, instead, the learning process would require high quality of cooperation and collaboration. By taking classes online, collaboration and learning interactions would be reduced seriously and might result in ineffective learning. For literacy and arts-related subjects, I would prefer to study online. However, for science, technology, engineering, or maths courses, I would prefer a face to face teaching on campus.", "options": [{"content": "What are the advantages?"}, {"content": "What are the disadvantages?"}, {"content": "What are some subjects that you would not like to study online?"}], "difficulty": 1, "difficultyName": "\u7b80\u5355\uff08100\u4ee5\u4e0b\uff09"}, "msg": "\u8bf7\u6c42\u6210\u529f\uff01"}
