Provide reasons to support your opinion.", "answer": "I believe self-driving vehicles are less safe than human-operated vehicles. Human-operated vehicles are usually based on mechanical mechanisms, so once humans give a reaction, they are less likely to experience a fail on cars. However, self-driving cars have two components, software and hardware, the hardware is the traditional car mechanics, but apart from that, there are also software systems to give instruction to the hardware part. If there is any crash or bug on the software, then it is hard for the human to get back control, so a more catastrophic accident is likely to happen."}, "msg": "\u8bf7\u6c42\u6210\u529f\uff01"}
