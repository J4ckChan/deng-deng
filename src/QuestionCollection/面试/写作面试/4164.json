Explain what is important about that time period to you.", "answer": "If I could travel to any time period from the past, I would choose to travel to the summer of 2008 because it was when 2008 Beijing Olympics Games were held, and I would very much like to get into the national stadium to watch the games. Beijing was the Games of records and superlatives. The Opening Ceremony was unforgettable; the athletes' achievements were astonishing, the organisation was excellent; the venues breathtaking and the anti-doping tests were stricter. More than 40 world records and over 130 Olympic records were broken. On top of all those, the National Stadium, nick-named the \"Bird's Nest\", and the National Swimming Centre, known as the \"Water Cube\", were both stunning symbols of the new Beijing. Sitting inside of them to watch the games would definitely be spectacular. (132\u5b57)"}, "msg": "\u8bf7\u6c42\u6210\u529f\uff01"}
