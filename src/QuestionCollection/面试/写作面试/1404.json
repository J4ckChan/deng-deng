Explain the reasons for your choice.", "answer": "When it comes to a certain thing that people have to have in order to be happy, I suppose that would be love. First and foremost, everyone must have been told a number of lovely tales when they were young, and every single story would necessarily end up with a happy ending, which is submerged by true love. Love is the only most crucial thing that forges the bonds between people. In most cases, people's relationship is hinged on love, and a healthy relationship can definitely bring happiness to one's life. That kind of happiness lasts forever. \uff0897 \u5b57\uff09"}, "msg": "\u8bf7\u6c42\u6210\u529f\uff01"}
