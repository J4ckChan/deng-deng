The woman wears white clothes and a pair of glasses. She has brown hair and she seems to be talking to the man sitting beside her. The man wears a black shirt and has very short hair. This picture seems to be a seminar of some sort in an African village. The woman might be collecting data by interviewing these people for her research. The research might be about African development and the livelihood of the local people. I hope more people go to Africa to support local development.", "photo": "https://cdn.51ddedu.com/images/616991650006179840.jpg", "difficulty": 2, "difficultyName": "\u4e00\u822c\uff08105~115\uff09"}, "msg": "\u8bf7\u6c42\u6210\u529f\uff01"}
