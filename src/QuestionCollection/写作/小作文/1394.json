Give specific reasons for your answer.\"", "answer": "When it comes to the importance of music in our society, I suppose everyone has his or her own type of music. For centuries, music has been playing a significant role in everyone's life, regardless of their social status, educational background, or personality. This is not only because music is a typical form of art, but also because it can help people do many things. For instance, many students would like to listen to music when they are studying to help them calm down and think. Music is also an excellent vehicle by which history is uniquely presented to its audience. Musicians express their feelings and understandings of the world around them in masterpieces, and other people of their age, as well as later generations, can share the same emotions and wisdom by appreciating their music work. To put it in a nutshell, music is of critical importance for people and society as a whole. \uff08153 \u5b57\uff09", "difficulty": 2, "difficultyName": "\u4e00\u822c\uff08105~115\uff09"}, "msg": "\u8bf7\u6c42\u6210\u529f\uff01"}
