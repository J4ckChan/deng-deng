From this picture, we can see a white kite with purple decoration, which is similar to a bat in shape. It is located in a desert. This made me suddenly think of the plot of a film. In this film, there are clips of kites falling into the desert with the wind. While waiting for people to find it, there were no witnesses nearby. Everyone was guessing the source of the kites, but no one knew where the kites in the desert came from. This is a thought-provoking picture.", "difficulty": 1, "difficultyName": "\u7b80\u5355\uff08100\u4ee5\u4e0b\uff09"}, "msg": "\u8bf7\u6c42\u6210\u529f\uff01"}
