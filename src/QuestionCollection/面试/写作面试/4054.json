Explain your reasoning.", "answer": "The controversial topic concerning the impact on the society has launched a heated debate on whether it is more important to have an impact on the world or on a few people. As far as I am concerned, I tend to be an advocate of the former regarding this issue. That is to say, it is necessary for people to appreciate and value the collective goal of human society since it is of great significance. If an impact is only put into practice on a few people, the rest of the community will be highly likely to remain unchanged, which will in turn undermine the effect as people tend to act in the same way as the majority do. Therefore, if an impact is to be made effective, it is recommended to have it on the world rather than a few people. (142\u5b57)"}, "msg": "\u8bf7\u6c42\u6210\u529f\uff01"}
