What was it you were pursuing and why?", "answer": "When I was 7 years old, I tried very hard to become good at playing the guitar. It was a summer holiday and I heard music coming out from my neighbour, so I asked my mom what that instrument was. My mom said it was guitar, so I decided to learn it because I loved that sound. Then I begged my mom to buy me a guitar which was quite expensive at the time and my mom wouldn't know if I was able to continue learning it. So it took a while for me to get my guitar. And after that, I went to a guitar class and started to learn how to play it and soon became quite good at it."}, "msg": "\u8bf7\u6c42\u6210\u529f\uff01"}
