Give specific reasons for your answer.\"", "answer": "If I have the opportunity to visit a foreign country for two weeks, I would most like to visit Australia. Australia has great weather and beautiful scenery of beaches and mountains. The Great Barrier Reef in Queensland is one of the most superb attractions in the world. The Blue Mountains in Sydney is another great national park to visit especially for someone who loves to go hiking. Food in Sydney is another important factor. Since there are a lot of migrants from everywhere around the world in Sydney, there are different types of authentic cuisines from all over the world. Therefore, eating in Sydney means eating around the world. That is why I would like to visit Australia.", "difficulty": 1, "difficultyName": "\u7b80\u5355\uff08100\u4ee5\u4e0b\uff09"}, "msg": "\u8bf7\u6c42\u6210\u529f\uff01"}
