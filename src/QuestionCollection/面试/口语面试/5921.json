Do you agree or disagree with this statement? Use examples from your personal experience or observations to support your position.", "answer": "I agree with this opinion of happiness is always simple, easy and free. I feel happen when hiking along the coast, when sailing on the ferry, and when collecting the shells on the beach. Those cost nothing but definitely fill you with 100% of happiness and energy. The sense of simple happiness comes from relaxation and enjoyment. Hence, happiness can be super easy, just remember to be grateful for everything you have, and enjoy everything you have. It doesn't have to be costly but requires you to feel it with your sincere heart."}, "msg": "\u8bf7\u6c42\u6210\u529f\uff01"}
