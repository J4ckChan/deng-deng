How did you respond to the failure, and what did you learn from the experience?", "answer": "I was about to write a 100,000 words book within three months. However, I failed it. After I failed to achieve my goal, I felt very sad initially and I was very disappointed with myself. But, later on, I realized that I could pick it up from where I left and continue to work on my stories. Eventually, I finished my book and it took approximately half a year for me to complete the entire book. I was happy with this result and was very proud of myself. This experience made me realize that sometimes when we fail something all we need to do is stop being negligent and keep trying. "}, "msg": "\u8bf7\u6c42\u6210\u529f\uff01"}
