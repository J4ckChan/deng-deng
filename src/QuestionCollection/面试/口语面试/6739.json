Choose a cause that you care about and describe why you chose that cause, where you would like the donation to go to, and how it would bring about changes.", "answer": "If I have extra money to give to a charity or to donate, I would contribute to education. In Chinese society, educational resources are not allocated rationally. The reason for this is because of the urban population.

So, students who were born in a place like Beijing and Shanghai, students would have exceeding resources, opportunities, and resources. Although Shanghai and Beijing have dense populations, they have super-advanced education resources. However, for students who were born in Henan or Hebei provinces, study resources, and education diversities are disasters. The reason is that in those two provinces, there are enormous numbers of students but they have a lack of study resources."}, "msg": "\u8bf7\u6c42\u6210\u529f\uff01"}
