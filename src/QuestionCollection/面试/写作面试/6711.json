How did you resolve the disagreement? What did you learn from this experience?", "answer": "The last time I had a disagreement with someone was terrible, but we finally resolve the disagreement and I have learned many things from this experience. I had this disagreement with my friend Lee who argued that climate change was not caused by human behaviors and that climate change is a conspiracy rather than a fact. I couldn't agree with his opinion. It is undeniable that climate change exists and it is caused by greenhouse gas emission which is primarily due to human activities. We finally set aside the dispute and decided not to argue anymore. I learned that there are some people who you just cannot reason with and it is a waste of time to get into the argument at the beginning."}, "msg": "\u8bf7\u6c42\u6210\u529f\uff01"}
