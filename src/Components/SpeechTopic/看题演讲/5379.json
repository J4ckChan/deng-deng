It was the time when I just finished my HSC exams, I went back to my hometown for holidays and my dad forced me to practice driving to get a full license. I took 4 exams, and the first and the last ones are for theoretical driving knowledge and the second and third ones are for practical driving skills. For practicing driving, we had to scan our photo ID every single time before we start, and practicing hours and distance would be accumulated as a condition to determine if we were eligible to do the driving tests. After I passed all the tests, I applied for my license at the public security bureau.", "options": [{"content": "Where do you go to apply for a license?"}, {"content": "What exams are involved?"}, {"content": "What documents are required?"}], "difficulty": 3, "difficultyName": "\u96be\uff08120\u4ee5\u4e0a\uff09"}, "msg": "\u8bf7\u6c42\u6210\u529f\uff01"}
