Provide reasons to support your opinion.", "answer": "Professional athletes definitely deserve to be paid high salaries. First of all, professional athletes spend most of their time training. They don't have enough time to practice other skills, and they usually retire early. By then, they may not have the skill to make a living. Secondly, their high-intensity training would always make their physical health overloaded. They are the top athletes of a nation or even the world, so during the training, every athlete has a lot of injuries. A high salary should be applied as compensation as well as a life quality guarantee. Thirdly, professional athletes bring honors and awards to the nation and contribute to the sports development of the next generation, so they are scarce resources. By the basic principle of demand and supply, they deserve to be paid more."}, "msg": "\u8bf7\u6c42\u6210\u529f\uff01"}
