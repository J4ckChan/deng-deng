Texting is virtually instantaneous. You type in your message, send it, and most of the time the recipient receives the message within seconds. Writing and sending often takes less time than emailing, and there's much less danger of getting embroiled in a long conversation like what can happen with a phone call.", "difficulty": 2, "difficultyName": "\u4e00\u822c\uff08105~115\uff09"}, "msg": "\u8bf7\u6c42\u6210\u529f\uff01"}
