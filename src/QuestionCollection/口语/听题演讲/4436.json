Many people think that a marathon is beyond them and that they could never train for one, but people of all shapes and sizes, ages, and abilities have successfully run a marathon. Setting the marathon goal, completing the training, and then successfully running the race will prove to them that they can tackle almost anything if you put your mind to it. Running for a charity cause is also a significant reason why many people run marathons. To run the 26.2 miles is a tremendous achievement, but to do it for charity makes it doubly rewarding. Knowing that they are running for charity provides extra motivation.
