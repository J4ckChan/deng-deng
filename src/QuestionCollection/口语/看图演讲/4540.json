He wears a short-sleeved black shirt, a pair of black jeans and black shoes, which I suppose are his uniform. Also, he has got a pair of headphones over his ears and a red bottle in his right hand. The upper half of the racing car is being lifted by a black metal pole which has a triangular shape at each end of it, while the bottom half, which constitutes the dynamic system of the racing car, is being shown for display, examination and repair purposes. Interestingly, the two front tyres of the racing car are much thinner and smaller than the two rear ones. To the right of the picture, I can see another man in black. I reckon both of the men near the car are technicians. In the background, there are a number of other people who seem to be audiences.
