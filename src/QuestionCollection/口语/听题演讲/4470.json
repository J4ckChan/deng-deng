Firstly, the country will face a dramatic economic recession after the disaster. This is because thousands of people lose their jobs and careers in the catastrophe, which will greatly hinder the economic development of the country. In addition, people's life quality will be deeply impacted after the disaster as the basic infrastructures, such as the electric systems and public transportation, may be destroyed in the disaster.
