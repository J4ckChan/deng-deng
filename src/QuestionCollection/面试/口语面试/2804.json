What's the hardest part of making that food? How did you learn to make it?", "answer": "I can make delicious macarons at home. Colorful, adorable, and bite-sized, their soft meringue exterior crumbles almost too easily into their smooth, creamy filling once they're safely in your mouth. Unfortunately, making them is hardly as simple. The trickiest part is getting the meringue shell right. Each individual shell should be frail, crisp, and smooth, so the baking process can be quite long and drawn out. To make them soft and shiny, you'll need a steady hand when piping out the mixture. Getting the meringue mixture right is pretty technique sensitive, too. Some chefs say that the eggs you use will need to be at least two weeks old, while the egg whites themselves will need to sit out at room temperature for 24 hours before you can even think about whisking. When I first ate macarons, I feel in love with this sweet food. That's why I searched for videos online and learned by myself. I spent a lot of time and energy learning how to make them, and finally, I succeed. (173 words)"}, "msg": "\u8bf7\u6c42\u6210\u529f\uff01"}
