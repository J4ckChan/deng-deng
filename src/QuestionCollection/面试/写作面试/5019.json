How did you decide what to create and which materials to use? How did your family and friends respond when you shared it with them?", "answer": "When I was about 13 years old, I made my first song. Although I was not very good at composing songs back then I made it anyway. I see writing songs as an urge rather than a skill. Therefore, instead of deciding what to create or how to create it, I let my instinct take control and it just naturally came to me. But I did use software to help me record the song. After I made the song I was so proud of myself. So, I shared with everyone I knew.  My parents were pretty happy about my achievement. But one of my friends criticized my work because she did not like the lyrics. She even volunteered to help me update the lyrics. Now, this song is absolutely perfect!
