How did you feel about not getting it? What did you learn from this experience, and how will it help you in life?", "answer": "There was a time that I really wanted to have junk food but I could not. Because I was having some weight issues. Due to the past 12 months, I let myself eat whatever I wanted to eat and it included some very unhealthy choices, including junk food, cakes, sweets, and carbonated drinks. Last week, I decided to quit unhealthy food and started to participate in physical exercises every morning. Things went well for two days. However, after that, I started to crave all the unhealthy food. After going through a lot of pain, I finally decided to ignore my cravings and went for some exercise. I felt much better after the workout and I was proud of myself that I did not start to eat junk food again. I think I will keep up with my new routine because I believe that it could help me improve my overall health. "}, "msg": "\u8bf7\u6c42\u6210\u529f\uff01"}
