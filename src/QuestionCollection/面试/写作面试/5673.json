What types of classes do you think benefit the most from having a discussion format? For instance, do you think math classes benefit from having a format where everyone participates and discusses?", "answer": "I think discussion can help people learn more by exchanging ideas and intuitions. However, some drawbacks may happen as the academic discussion can easily turn into a daily conversation. I think STEM courses including Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics can be benefited more from the class-based discussion. The reason is those courses are usually difficult and would need peer stimulation to trigger problem-solving skills. Different people may have different thoughts to figure out a hard question, and people can always learn from each other."}, "msg": "\u8bf7\u6c42\u6210\u529f\uff01"}
