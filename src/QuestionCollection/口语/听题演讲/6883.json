This can happen in many ways. Having better air quality improves the lives of people in the community. For example, building a public garden that is full of plants can improve the air quality in the surrounding area because plants take into carbon dioxide and release oxygen. Having a quiet and tranquil place to walk into provides local people with an opportunity to relax and relieve their stress. For instance, people living in cities usually feel stressed and if they have such a public garden to go to, then they can recalibrate themselves after a stressful day. Otherwise, they might have to live with the stress and sooner or later this accumulation of stress can bring them down. Therefore, public gardens are important in improving the quality of life.", "referenceText": "In what ways can public gardens improve communities and the lives of people who live there\uff1f", "referenceTranslate": "\u516c\u5171\u82b1\u56ed\u80fd\u4ee5\u4ec0\u4e48\u65b9\u5f0f\u6539\u5584\u793e\u533a\u548c\u5c45\u6c11\u7684\u751f\u6d3b?", "difficulty": 2, "difficultyName": "\u4e00\u822c\uff08105~115\uff09"}, "msg": "\u8bf7\u6c42\u6210\u529f\uff01"}
