Provide reasons to support your opinion.", "answer": "Although some people claim that parents or other financial supporters do not have a right to see their students' grades, in my opinion, stakeholders do have the right to see students\u2019 grades. The main reason is that they need to see how children perform so they can improve and reflect on their future practices. Students\u2019 grades provide great insight into their performances, and thus it is a great way for involving stakeholders to look at the grades and see what has been doing well and what has not and make adjustments and improvements.
