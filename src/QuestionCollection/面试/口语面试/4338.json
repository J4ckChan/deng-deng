What makes this a difficult topic to discuss? Who can you talk with about this topic, and what do you gain from talking about it?", "answer": "It is normal that one would like to share a lot of things with his or her friends. However, there is usually something that one would not like to discuss. For me, it is my first presentation in front of the class in year 9 because I totally messed it up. And it is still rather embarrassing for me to even mention a word about it. I was a quite introverted person then. Therefore, it was extremely challenging for me to stand in front of the entire class and speak. I did write the speech in advance and practiced several times. But my mind went blank when I started the speech. The only person I can talk with about this topic is the teacher in charge of my class. Aftering discussing with her, I understand that many things could be hard and effortful at one time, but practice makes perfect. (150\u5b57)"}, "msg": "\u8bf7\u6c42\u6210\u529f\uff01"}
