How would knowing another language benefit you? How would you use your new knowledge of this language?", "answer": "People should learn a new language to eliminate communication barriers. If I know another language, for example, French, I would be able to access French culture and make French friends more easily. This would benefit me from different dimensions, for example, looking at problems from the logic of a different cultural background, and lift my fashion taste because French is the capital of fashion and trend."}, "msg": "\u8bf7\u6c42\u6210\u529f\uff01"}
