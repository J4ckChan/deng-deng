Who are your favorite artists who perform this type of music and why are they your favorite? How do you think this music contributes to society?", "answer": "Pop music is a genre of popular music that originated in its modern form during the mid-1950s in the United States and the United Kingdom. The terms popular music and pop music are often used interchangeably, although the former describes all music that is popular and includes many disparate styles. And my favorite pop singer is Taylor Swift. She believes that all girls and women across the world should feel empowered with their being. Not only does the singer believe in empowering women, but she also tries to help empower other celebrities to strive in their careers. Pop music can encourage individuals to think about where they're going in the world to inform the decisions they make to help forge an identity. But while music might be consumed in solitude, taking hold of imaginations as you listen in bedrooms and on headphones, it has a unifying effect.
