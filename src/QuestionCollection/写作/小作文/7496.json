What happened? Include specific details in your answer.\"", "answer": "I felt unfair when I was in the university. I had always been treated badly. Many people knew me so well that they reached out to me whenever they needed financial help. And that\u2019s the end. They never even cared to tell me after they got the required help from me. I saw them talking and chatting so well with others but ignore me. But the irony was when they need help, they\u2019d use all possible ways to communicate with me. Even my relatives badly betrayed me. I was still single may be because of my dark complexion. I had a good job and I earned pretty well. But every time someone came into my life only to extract things from me. I did not think anyone likes me. I felt so bad being treated badly. Not just one person but all who I encountered do this to me. I did not have even one true friend and I felt so lonely and upset. I was totally scared of anyone who came in friendly because eventually, they were going to cheat me. This fear and bad feeling were the results of being treated unfairly.
