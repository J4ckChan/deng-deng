What can you do to solve it?", "answer": "Personally speaking, I am rather concerned about the environmental issue that we human are facing, particularly the global warming problem. I believe that we, as individuals, can all make choices that will greatly reduce our global warming impacts.  We can make smart choices by using energy-efficient products. For instance, normally, I choose to travel to and from my university, workplace and shopping malls by public transportations, such as buses and undergrounds, rather than a private car, which can help reduce the emission of greenhouse gasses. Also, we need to understand which areas of our life generate the most carbon emissions. For example, I learnt that air-conditioners, televisions, washing machines etc. consume the most power, and hence I deliberately looked at their energy consumption ratings when I bought them. What's more, making climate-friendly choices can save my money at the same time. That is to say, these more environmentally friendly appliances may cost a bit more initially, but the energy savings will pay back the extra investment within a couple of years.\uff08171 \u5b57\uff09"}, "msg": "\u8bf7\u6c42\u6210\u529f\uff01"}
