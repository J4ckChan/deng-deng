Both of them wear hard hats, which indicates that they are on a construction site. One of them is wearing a blue T-shirt and making a phone call while looking at the tall building behind him. The other one is wearing a T-shirt with blue and white stripes and a pair of white trousers, and he is looking in the opposite direction.
