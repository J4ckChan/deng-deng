Explain your reasoning.", "answer": "I always believe that some limitations can be overcome while some others cannot. It depends on whether the problem is solvable and it also depends on the determination of the person. I believe once I am determined, then I should always try to over the limitations. The reason is that without the thorough investigation and firm belief, problems cannot be solved. Limitations always exist in all kinds of settings. For example, some people may be inept at learning a second language. They may find it difficult to break through the bottleneck during the learning. However, since it is a solvable problem, people should try to overcome it. Thus, we should always try to overcome solvable problem and to do that, we have to be determined.\uff08125 \u5b57\uff09"}, "msg": "\u8bf7\u6c42\u6210\u529f\uff01"}
