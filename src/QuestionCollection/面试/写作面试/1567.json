But now being in the same boat, being a well-known feature in my university, these things seem shallow and not satisfactory. They have given me a great experience and a scintillating time to cherish but that\u2019s not what important now. In all the rush and competition of being the best on stage and being admired, I missed out on a lot of things. The most important thing to me now is spending time with my own team more and enjoying the performances rather than sulking for results. \uff08109 \u5b57\uff09"}, "msg": "\u8bf7\u6c42\u6210\u529f\uff01"}
