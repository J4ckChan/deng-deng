That is to say, routine work keeps people highly occupied both physically and mentally, which necessarily generates stresses and strains which exhaust people. Therefore, people tend to do things that are refreshingly relaxing after work. And once they are into that light mode, inertia prevents people from getting back to production mode. Wasting time undoubtedly will decrease people's work efficiency, which in turn will lead to consequences such as missing deadlines and loss of motivation. In terms of ways people can avoid wasting time, it is highly recommended that people make plans with a strict deadline for every single task prior to taking action. Alternatively, people are suggested to keep away from any potential distractions while performing tasks. For example, they can turn off notifications from all social media beforehand.
