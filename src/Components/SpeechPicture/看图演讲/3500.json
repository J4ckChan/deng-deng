The girl is holding a glass of beer. The content they are watching interests them since both of them are smiling happily. It seems that they are in a room where there are green plants and a bookshelf full of books on it. This reminds me of my university time when I always held small parties with my friends. At that time, we always had the energy and passion to make new acquaintances regardless of their major, gender, or background. We shared our opinions on diverse topics such as subjects, extra-curriculum activities, and books, and discussed dreams and futures. The room we were living in is small, but our dreams are great.
