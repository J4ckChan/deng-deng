It was my parent's marriage anniversary and I wanted to make it a grand celebration so I and my brother planned a beautiful celebration. It was my parent's thirtieth marriage anniversary so we decided to call our family friends and close relatives to be a part of a wonderful function and we all wanted to give them a surprise party. We booked a hotel in our town, decided on the menu for food, and we decorated the whole banquet hall. This hotel has the best facilities, amenities, and infrastructure to facilitate the guests. At this celebration, all our relatives and cousins were present and they supported me in organizing such a wonderful event. My cousins and younger brother did all the necessary bookings and reservations to make this event grand.", "referenceText": "Talk about an important anniversary you have celebrated.", "referenceTranslate": "\u8c08\u8c08\u4e00\u4e2a\u91cd\u8981\u7684\u4f60\u5e86\u795d\u8fc7\u7684\u7eaa\u5ff5\u65e5\u3002", "difficulty": 2, "difficultyName": "\u4e00\u822c\uff08105~115\uff09"}, "msg": "\u8bf7\u6c42\u6210\u529f\uff01"}
