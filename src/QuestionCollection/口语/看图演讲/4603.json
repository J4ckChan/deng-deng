The person is wearing a grey coat and a dark green dress. I can hardly tell the sex of the person lying on the street as the picture only shows the person's back. There is a piece of paper, cardboard, and other people around the person, which makes it look quite messy. I suppose the person is probably begging. And the reason for that could be homelessness, unemployment, or other disasters that happened to the person. Apart from the poor person lying on the ground, there are countless people walking on the street, which indicates that the picture is taken somewhere with a dense population, very likely in the CBD. An adult man, who is bald and wears a dark blue jacket and long pants, is walking past and looking at the person on the ground. Not sure if he is going to spare any changes to the poor person. In the background, there are some old-fashioned European-style buildings, which indicates the place is probably in a European country.
