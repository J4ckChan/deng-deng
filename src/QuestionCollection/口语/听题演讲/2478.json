I am friendly, generous, and considerate. While some would argue that kindness has a connotation of meaning someone is naive or weak, that is not the case. Being kind often requires courage and strength. Kindness is an interpersonal skill. Kindness is not a relatively common characteristic in today's society, because it usually involves devoting resources to others, rather than being self-interested, which means having more and more for myself. Nonetheless, kindness actually brings lasting well-being for me. I am always active when I see people in need. After being helped, people will appreciate your kindness, show you respect, and probably return the favor later when I need a hand. A sense of community is created when I am being kind to those who need help, and by helping others, I get a sense of fulfillment. \uff08152 \u5b57\uff09", "referenceText": "Describe a quality of your personal character that you find important.
