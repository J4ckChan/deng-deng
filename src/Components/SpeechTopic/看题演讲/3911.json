The global population is expected to exceed 10 billion within the current century. Plus climate change, urbanization, and soil degradation will shrink the availability of arable land. Together they will lead to far greater stress on food supplies. What's worse, global water shortage and pollution can have a devastating effect on crops. Therefore, the likelihood of food shortages in the future is rather high. If food shortages occur in the future, I suppose people's food choices would greatly alter. One of the most likely switches would be to preserve food, such as canned spam and vegetables because it can be easily stored and last much longer than those freshly harvested. People will get supplementary food sources from synthetic food made by using nanotechnology.
