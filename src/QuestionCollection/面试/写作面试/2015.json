Explain your reasoning.", "answer": "Bullying is when someone or a group of people who have more power than you, repeatedly use words or actions to hurt you. Bullying can be very hurtful and cause lots of pain. In some cases, the one who has been bullied may bear the pain himself and keep a distance from the bullies. But this won't stop the bullying. In worse scenarios, the one who has been bullied might fight back, and their approach may not be appropriate and justifiable due to the lack of thoughtfulness and maturity. Sometimes the hatred may even cause serious problems. Therefore, it is advisable that there should be some type of judicial system in place to prevent further bullying from happening. From my perspective, kids also need to be reprimanded for what they do. Current laws aren't treating the problem seriously enough. Kids and teenagers are supposed to behave and treat their peers nicely. If the bullying is continuous and repetitive, then it should definitely be taken seriously. That is to say, bullying should be charged with a crime. However, it can be difficult to assess the extent of bullying due to a number of aspects. Therefore, a simple offense of bullying should be defined as a criminal offense. But in the case of young people, it would not involve any imprisonment or detention, but other sanctions, such as community service, can help young people learn the value of kindness and start to treat others well. Schools, workplaces, communities, and parents should all be involved in trying to stamp out bullying before it causes harm.\uff08262 \u5b57\uff09"}, "msg": "\u8bf7\u6c42\u6210\u529f\uff01"}
