Specifically, watching television may increase violent or aggressive behavior. What recommendations would you make to parents based on this evidence? Give specific reasons for your recommendations.\"", "answer": "The controversial issue in respect of children's TV watching has attracted the public's attention and sparked a heated debate in recent years. As far as I am concerned, exposure to violent content does not necessarily cause violent or aggressive behavior. As for children, if parents are going to show them violent media, tell kids that media is only meant to be entertaining and that in real life, violence is not okay, and make sure they understand the consequences of real-world violence. By doing so, when children play and watch violent media, they will know that it is only entertaining, not something meant to be copied. They can consume such media, and still be a good person. Besides, parents can set limits on how much television their children are allowed to watch on a daily or weekly basis in order to minimize the effect of the TV content that can potentially have on children.
