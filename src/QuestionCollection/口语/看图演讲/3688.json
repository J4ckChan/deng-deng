The wall of the well is probably made of concrete which can be identified by its appearance. The man is wearing a white and yellow top and has short hair. Despite being at the bottom of the well, he does not look frustrated but looks rather happy, which is kind of weird. I suppose the reason may be that he finally received help from other people from outside of the well as I can see a rope has been thrown into the well in an attempt to rescue him, or that he is merely playing a game, say hide-and-seek, with his mates. Either way, he is now not scared or panicked at all.
