What made him or her such a good teacher? What is one lesson your teacher taught that you will never forget?", "answer": "The most effective teacher I have ever had was Mrs Sharp. She was passionate about geography and had spent her 20s employed as a GIS scientist before becoming a teacher, so she had lots of anecdotes to support every bit of content we were learning. But most of all, I think she cared about all of us. She engaged us in the content and saw that if we particularly enjoyed a subject, she'd bring it to life somehow. For instance, the most memorable lesson she taught was when we studied the Pacific island culture, we had a shared lunch of Pacific fruits and foods and talked about how the people living there farm and trade. She started dialogues and encouraged enjoyment. I'll never forget what she says - no question is silly, and no answer is wrong. (137\u5b57)"}, "msg": "\u8bf7\u6c42\u6210\u529f\uff01"}
