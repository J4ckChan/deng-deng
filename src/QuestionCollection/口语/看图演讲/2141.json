It is a sunny day as I can tell from the bright sunshine on the top left corner of the picture. The mobile phone he is using is black and white, and it is quite small compared with the size of his palm, and by the look of the phone, I can tell that it is an old-fashioned phone, which indicates that either the picture was taken decades ago, or the man is not that rich to afford a better device. The man has dark skin, short hair, and a bushy beard. He wears a white top. His mouth is not open, so he must be listening to the person speaking on the other end of the phone. He is knitting his brows as if the news he is hearing is rather serious or terrible, and he is raising his other hand up in the air, doing some sort of gesture. \uff08183 \u5b57\uff09", "photo": "https://cdn.51ddedu.com/images/477110135748038656.jpg", "difficulty": 1, "difficultyName": "\u7b80\u5355\uff08100\u4ee5\u4e0b\uff09"}, "msg": "\u8bf7\u6c42\u6210\u529f\uff01"}
