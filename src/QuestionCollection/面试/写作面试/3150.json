Explain your reasoning.", "answer": "To me, home means not one, but many things. Most importantly, I believe that home means a secure, cheerful place where you are respected and loved. Everybody deserves to know the true meaning of home. Home means an enjoyable, happy place where you can live, laugh and learn. It's somewhere where you are loved, respected, and cared for. When you look at it from the outside, home is just a house. A building. Maybe a yard. But on the inside, it's a lot more than wood and bricks. The saying \"Home is where the heart is\" says it all. Home is also where your memories lie. Home is where I got my head stuck under the couch. Home is where I fell in the goldfish pond. I remember sleeping in the playhouse, falling down the stairs and climbing up the apple tree. Without memories, most people wouldn't be the people that they are today. Just like memories, home is also where your hopes and dreams are. Dreaming about when you grow up. Being a spaceman or a firefighter. Sinking beneath the sea as a scuba diver. I couldn't imagine living without dreams. My home grounds them, and without a home, I wouldn't have any. (204\u5b57)"}, "msg": "\u8bf7\u6c42\u6210\u529f\uff01"}
