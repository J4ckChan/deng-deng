Why do you think this quality improves how politicians do their job? Would it be good for everyone to have these qualities?", "answer": "Politicians are expected to accomplish different tasks than ordinary citizens. They might therefore be expected to possess certain traits and skills to engage in a leading position, to work effectively with the public, or to communicate through news media. As a consequence, citizens want candidates to exhibit certain required traits to a larger or lesser degree than they exhibit themselves. As far as I am concerned, trustworthy is one of the most important qualities for successful politicians. Politicians always have simple, straightforward plans for big changes and include citizens in them. If people vote for a candidate with a big plan, they have contributed to the lofty goal. If they are promised a big goal will be met and it doesn't happen, the backlash can be horrible. When politicians are proven to be wrong or lying, they are considered far less trustworthy, and citizens will lose faith in the government, which will lead to a range of worse consequences. It would be great for everyone to have this quality as truth is the rock foundation of healthy relationships. (178\u5b57)"}, "msg": "\u8bf7\u6c42\u6210\u529f\uff01"}
