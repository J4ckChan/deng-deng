What were you doing there, and who was with you? How did you feel when you saw this place?", "answer": "The most beautiful place that I have ever visited is the Monterey Bay in California. I went there with my friends for our graduation trip. There are several little towns/communities there: Monterey, Carmel-by-the-Sea, Pacific Grove, and 17-mile Drive. They all are incredible. In the harbor of Monterey, you can see sea otters and seals. There is also a very nice and interesting aquarium there. During the summer, the beach in Pacific Grove is covered with flowers. Carmel-by-the-Sea is an artist community with many art galleries. The beaches in Carmel are gorgeous. And there are many, many, many CYPRESS TREES. In case that wasn't enough, on the 17-mile Drive, there are lots of millionaires (in fact they all are) and even some celebrities. I will conclude by saying that the Monterey is such a wonderful place, and I hope I can go there again in the near future. \uff08147\u5b57\uff09"}, "msg": "\u8bf7\u6c42\u6210\u529f\uff01"}
