Provide reasons to support your opinion.", "answer": "Although some people argue that we no longer need to learn history in the modern world, I personally believe that it is essential for us to learn it. Through learning history, we can learn how past societies, systems, ideologies, governments, cultures and technologies were built, how they operated, and how they have changed.
