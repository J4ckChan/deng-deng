Give a few examples.\"", "answer": "Before you go to a new country, you can make a checklist card for your convenience where you can mark all required facts. The first thing you should think about is the necessity to obtain a visa. Some countries invite tourists and do not require obtaining a visa. However, there are countries, such as my country, to visit which you should apply for or buy a visa. It must be done in advance or you will be rejected to enter the country. Furthermore, you should think about buying medical insurance to cover the cost of possible treatment or at least learn where you can turn to if you need medical assistance. In the last case, it is very important to have money with you, or you may be refused.", "difficulty": 2, "difficultyName": "\u4e00\u822c\uff08105~115\uff09"}, "msg": "\u8bf7\u6c42\u6210\u529f\uff01"}
