Do you volunteer in your community? Why or why not?", "answer": "There are many ways that you can volunteer to do in the community, for example, organize a yard sale for charity or serve free food for the homeless people. I usually do many volunteer jobs in my free time because I believe volunteering is a great way to meet new people, especially if you are new to an area. It strengthens your ties to the community and broadens your support network, exposing you to people with common interests, neighborhood resources, and fulfilling activities.\uff0883 \u5b57\uff09"}, "msg": "\u8bf7\u6c42\u6210\u529f\uff01"}
