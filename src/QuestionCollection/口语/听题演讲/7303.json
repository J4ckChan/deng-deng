And now my lab actually has the ability and power to design it. Biology is sort of the next level of genetic engineering. About 4 years ago, scientists and engineers at my university developed techniques to basically move pieces of DNA from one organism to another. And it was sort of done by physically cutting and pasting. As a result, we\u2019re moving beyond that where we can write DNA, which means we\u2019re no longer limited to the piece we can cut from one and put in another. We can chemically synthesize this DNA on a machine and put that into an organism, and now we can even create new organisms, completely from scratch. We plan to finish this project next month. And it will be very helpful to all humans.
