Doing risky things without thinking twice and not taking into consideration the consequences was what I used to think being adventurous is. That was the definition of adventure implanted within me. Now I believe being adventurous simply is \"getting out of comfort zone\". Whenever I do the things that I normally don't do in my comfort zone is the adventurous thing for me. It's true that things such as going on unplanned trips, taking prompt decisions are certainly adventurous but that's not it. And in my case, I'm an introvert, so talking to strangers is an adventurous act for me. I have been trying to get out of my comfort zone and do acts that I am not familiar with. Therefore, I consider myself an adventurous person. (142\u5b57)", "referenceText": "Do you consider yourself an adventurous person?
