Explain your reasoning.", "answer": "From my point of view, I reckon that most people are untrustworthy. The first reason for my argument is that it is reasonable to believe that everyone is living in their own interests. Therefore, if there are conflicts of interests, they are more likely to fight for their own interests.  Moreover, in current society, competition is so fierce that people may need to sacrifice other's interest to survive no matter in study, work, or life. For instance, if two employees are the candidates for one team leader position, that other two cannot trust each other on work. What's more, the relationship among people become gradually distant in modern society, so people lack empathy and don't care about others too much. They tend to not make commitments or fail to fulfil the commitment. In conclusion, with all the reasons mentioned about, I consider most people as untrustworthy.
