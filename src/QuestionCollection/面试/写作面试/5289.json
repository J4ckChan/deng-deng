Provide reasons to support your opinion.", "answer": "I believe that educational travel should be included as part of any high school education, although some people might hold a different point of view. The main reason is that educational travel can help high students broaden their views. Because they can experience different cultures and gain a better understanding of diversification and show respect to people from different backgrounds and cultures. Secondly, this type of travel provides them a great opportunity to feel relaxed and get a break from their workloads."}, "msg": "\u8bf7\u6c42\u6210\u529f\uff01"}
