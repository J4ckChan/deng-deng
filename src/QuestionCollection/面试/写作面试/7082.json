Provide reasons to support your opinion.", "answer": "Some people believe that doing nothing is always a waste of time, while I personally think that it can be valuable. This is because doing nothing frees our minds from the hustle and bustle of our daily lives. It gives us space and time to rest and reflect. This is very important as in modern days, many people do not rest or do self-reflection simply because they are too busy. The only time they rest is the time they sleep, and this is not enough. Not doing self-reflection also brings the same mistakes over and over leading to hardship in working and studying. Therefore, it is critical to do nothing when it is necessary."}, "msg": "\u8bf7\u6c42\u6210\u529f\uff01"}
