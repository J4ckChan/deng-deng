What can you learn from their example? How would the world be different if more people were like him or her?", "answer": "When it comes to a person who I think makes the world a better place, the first person I can think of is Martin Luther King, who is the youngest man to receive the Nobel Peace Prize. He is best known for his speech called \"I Have a Dream\" in which he spoke out that \"One day, everyone would be treated as equals.\" In the eleven years between 1957 and 1968, King travelled over six million miles and spoke over twenty-five hundred times, appearing wherever there was an injustice, protest, and action. He is the greatest leader in the civil rights movement in America. What I can learn from him is that a true hero is not someone who has a superpower, but someone who can see what people's difficulties are and has the brave to stand up against injustice. If more people were like him, the world would become a much better place to live. (156\u5b57)"}, "msg": "\u8bf7\u6c42\u6210\u529f\uff01"}
