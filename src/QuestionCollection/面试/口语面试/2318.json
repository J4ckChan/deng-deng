Provide reasons to support your opinion.", "answer": "The modern classroom is aglow with screens. Children as young as five are packing their own personal computers and tablets in their schoolbags along with their lunchboxes. But people would argue: do laptops, tablets and phones in the classroom promote and enhance learning or do they bring with them a world of distraction for students and for teachers a battle for learners' attentions? Using computer technology in the classroom isn't just about digital devices in class \u2014 it relates to anything that facilitates an interaction between teachers and students. Personally speaking, technology can be harnessed to improve student engagement and effectiveness. Firstly, using technology in the classroom allows you to experiment more in pedagogy and get instant feedback. Secondly, there are countless resources for enhancing education and making learning more fun and effective. With technology in the classroom, students have instant access to fresh information that can supplement their learning experience. Thirdly, technology can automate a lot of your tedious tasks. Furthermore, we live in a digital world, and technology is a life skill. A 21st century view of learner success requires students to be thoughtful consumers of digital content. In conclusion, I hold the view that technology in the classroom can improve instruction.\uff08204 \u5b57\uff09"}, "msg": "\u8bf7\u6c42\u6210\u529f\uff01"}
