Give specific reasons for your answer.\"", "answer": "As this is the first time I see this expression, I suppose its meaning would be that a good picture taken by an excellent photographer has the ability to convey the meaning of a thousand words. Personally, I totally agree with this statement. This is because when the photographer was taking the picture, he or she was planning to tell the potential viewer a meaningful story by capturing an impressive moment using specific techniques. Say, a picture of the poor can vividly depict the hardship those people are experiencing, and hence induce viewers\u2019 deep empathy, which, by words, would probably require more than a thousand words. \uff08107 \u5b57\uff09", "difficulty": 2, "difficultyName": "\u4e00\u822c\uff08105~115\uff09"}, "msg": "\u8bf7\u6c42\u6210\u529f\uff01"}
