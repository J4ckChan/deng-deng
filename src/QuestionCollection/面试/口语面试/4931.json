Emil Sinclair has negative thinking about himself. The superego occurred when Sinclair decides that he belong to the dark world even though he knows his life goal was to become his father and mother that which is part of the bright world. This character reminds me of myself because I often tend to think negatively as well. Therefore, I feel related to this character. "}, "msg": "\u8bf7\u6c42\u6210\u529f\uff01"}
