Today, I would like to talk about someone who is courageous and not afraid to face his fear. The brave person is a distant cousin of mine, who is about 35 years old, and I have always found him to be very positive, confident, and brave. Whether it is with standing up for a person who is being picked on unjustly, standing against racism or prejudice, or taking a stand against the unfair social and economic practice, my distant cousin has always proved his worth as a courageous man. My distant cousin is a journalist \u2013 a brilliant and courageous journalist with a very strong heart. Trust me, being a good and objective journalist is not an easy thing these days because there is always a risk of being targeted unfairly by some crooked and anti-social people. However, a journalist chooses to run his pen, even knowing that there are risks. I would like to say that it is his determination to always remain truthful and objective in all kinds of adverse situations for the sake and benefit of our society that makes him a courageous person in my eyes. \uff08202 \u5b57\uff09", "referenceText": "Describe someone you think is courageous.
