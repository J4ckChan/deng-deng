My take on this issue is that I prefer to have a small group of friends. People who want to have many friends believe that making different friends makes them feel more valuable about their existence. However, I think friendship is not about how many but more about the quality of friendship. High-quality friendships bring more satisfaction and value to people. \uff0880 words\uff09"}, "msg": "\u8bf7\u6c42\u6210\u529f\uff01"}
