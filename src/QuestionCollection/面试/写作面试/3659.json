What two questions would you ask them? What would you hope to learn?", "answer": "Since my early childhood, I have loved playing football. So, it was quite natural for me to always admire a great footballer. But, never had I had the urge to meet a famous footballer until I saw a magician with football called Lionel Messi. If I ever get a chance to have dinner with this famous footballer, I would certainly ask for some autographs from him first. Then, of course, I would ask him what it was that really motivated him to become such a great footballer apart from the reason of being born in a football-obsessed country. Besides, I would ask him which moment he felt most satisfied. From his response, I expect to learn how I can overcome any hardship I am experiencing or I should encounter in the future. I really hope to be inspired by his great spirit. (142\u5b57)"}, "msg": "\u8bf7\u6c42\u6210\u529f\uff01"}
