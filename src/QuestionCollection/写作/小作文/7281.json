Do you agree or disagree? Why? Give specific reasons for your answer.\"", "answer": "I totally agree with this view. As children grow, they can be easily influenced by what they see and hear, especially from the TV. Some programs can be educational. But many programs can show children violent behavior that you don't want them to imitate, or that can cause fear. TV may also show children poor eating habits through commercials for high-calorie, low-nutrient foods. Too much screen time can also take away from reading, studying, learning activities, play, and exercise. Your child may be negatively affected. So watching TV is bad for children.
