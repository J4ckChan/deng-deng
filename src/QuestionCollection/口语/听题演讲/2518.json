They are excellent hosts whose attention to detail made my stay at Bathurst, an inner-west town 4 hours' drive from Sydney, most pleasant. I made the room reservation on Airbnb, which is an easy-to-use application mostly travelers nowadays are using to reserve accommodations prior to their arrival at the destination. The room I was offered was comfortable and nicely furnished, and the bathroom is large and well equipped. That was my first visit to Australia. The first day when I arrived at their place, it was already dinner time. I was surprised to find that they deliberately made me rice and beef stew, knowing that I am from China. However, they did not have chopsticks, so I used a fork and knife to eat rice for the first time in my life. The next morning, they served me a nice and fresh Aussie-style big breakfast, which was delicious. I very much appreciated the hosts' suggestions for cafes and restaurants in the area, as well as their help with my visit to the nearby tourist attractions, such as a blue mountain. The location of their house was convenient for me because I went from there to the National Park for hiking and kayaking. The lovely courtyard was such a nice place to enjoy a glass of wine while viewing the amazingly beautiful scenery. I feel extremely privileged to have the old couple as my hosts. I am genuinely grateful for everything they had done for me, they had been much more than simply hosts, but more like friends. \uff08270 \u5b57\uff09", "referenceText": "Talk about a time you were extended hospitality while you were traveling.", "referenceTranslate": "\u8c08\u8c08\u4f60\u5728\u65c5\u884c\u4e2d\u53d7\u5230\u70ed\u60c5\u6b3e\u5f85\u7684\u4e00\u6b21\u7ecf\u5386\u3002", "difficulty": 2, "difficultyName": "\u4e00\u822c\uff08105~115\uff09"}, "msg": "\u8bf7\u6c42\u6210\u529f\uff01"}
