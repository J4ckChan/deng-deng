It is a traditional festival celebrated in September or October, and the specific date is hard to fix because it is calculated by the lunar calendar. However, most people will try their best to know the date so they can prepare some special dishes and snacks for this festival. For example, we will make moon cakes by ourselves and buy several tasty dishes from restaurants in order to celebrate the Mid-Autumn Festival. Besides, it is also a family reunion day so all family members will try their best to come back home and have dinners together. Finally, if you ask me about how often I attend this event, I will directly answer that it happens once a year so I will only celebrate this event one time with all my family members. In conclusion, the Mid-Autumn Festival is an annual event in my country.
