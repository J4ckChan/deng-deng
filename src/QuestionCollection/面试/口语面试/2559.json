Explain the reasons for your choice.", "answer": "When it comes to the most important thing I need in order to have a happy life, I suppose it would be a healthy relationship. Personally speaking, the only thing that really matters in my life is my relationships with other people. I reckon what brings us the most happiness is family and friends. It is hard to think of life without relationships. I am terribly afraid of loneliness.   The root of happiness is not money, fame, or good looks\u2014it's the people we choose to surround ourselves with and how well we nurture our relationships with them. Having a better social life can be worth as much as an enormous amount of money in terms of life satisfaction. Most of what we do to relieve stress doesn't actually work. Friends, however, do take the edge off. This being said, as with most things in life, when it comes to build good relationships, quality is more important than quantity. We are only capable of having a finite number of people in our social sphere, probably 100 to 200? I cannot be sure of this. But I find it not easy to manage social network. Therefore, I choose to concentrate on a handful of friends in order to maintain quality relationships. Having someone in my life whom I would feel comfortable phoning anytime to tell my troubles to makes me feel relieved. \uff08232 \u5b57\uff09"}, "msg": "\u8bf7\u6c42\u6210\u529f\uff01"}
