Do you agree or disagree with this statement? Use examples from personal experience and observations to support your perspective.", "answer": "Some people state that cities are the best place to live, yet I personally believe that rural areas are much better places to live. People who live in cities are under huge stress from all aspects of life. For example, since living expenses are high, people in cities have to work hard. Thus, they have much less time for personal life. On the contrary, living in rural areas is less stressful. Overall, it is no doubt that rather than cities, rural areas are the best place to live."}, "msg": "\u8bf7\u6c42\u6210\u529f\uff01"}
