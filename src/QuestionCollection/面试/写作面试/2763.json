Provide reasons for why you chose that animal.", "answer": "As an unusual animal to care for, hedgehogs are ideal for someone who wants a pet but doesn't have a significant amount of time or resources to devote to their care and attention. Hedgehogs require a simple terrestrial enclosure that is big enough for them to run around and play in. Petting a happy hedgehog is a bit like affectionately stroking a bristly hairbrush. Attempting to pet an upset hedgehog is more like trying to soothe a wriggly cactus of doom. Hedgehogs are apart of the Erinaceinae family, and are neither rodent nor are they related to the very similar porcupine. They thrive off a simple diet of fruits and insects, all of which can be found in your kitchen or backyard. Hedgehogs are not social creatures, unlike many other smaller animals, so it is not recommended to house more than one in an enclosure. Most owners will feed them a low-fat dry cat food supplemented with vegetables, mealworms, and crickets, and keep them in a large, flat-bottomed cage.
