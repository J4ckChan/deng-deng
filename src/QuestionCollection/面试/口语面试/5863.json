What are some actions that people can take to be honest and kind at the same time?", "answer": "It is very important to be both honest and kind to gain reputation and trust from others. One action people can take to be honest and kind at the same time is being sincere and helpful from the bottom of their hearts. Once people have a really pure starting point, then their sincerity can always be sensed by other people. If people truly wish other people good, then that is defined as being kind; and if people reject to tell any lies, then that is defined as being honest. If people want to be honest and kind at the same time, people can choose to donate money, donate blood, build a charity, or help others in their daily lives."}, "msg": "\u8bf7\u6c42\u6210\u529f\uff01"}
