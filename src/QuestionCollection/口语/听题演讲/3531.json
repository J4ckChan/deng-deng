The most serious natural problem is that coastal cities are more likely to suffer from tsunamis, which will cause significant damages to the property and infrastructure. Moreover, the dumping in the sea also threatens the life of people there. Most residents in coastal cities are depending on the sea for a living, but water pollution leads to the decrease of marine animals. Besides, if the coastal areas are famous as scenic spots, local people and the government should take more investments and money to process the garbage left by the visitors. Normally, many important industrial centers are situated on estuaries. Numerous pipelines, data, and energy cables are buried in the seabed.
