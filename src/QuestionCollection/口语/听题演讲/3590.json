It is partly because I am a mild and easy-going person, and thus I would hardly be literally angry with anybody. The other reason is that acting in an aggressive manner towards someone who is rude to me, in my opinion, would not help ease the situation but could potentially worsen it, which would be the last thing I would like to see.
