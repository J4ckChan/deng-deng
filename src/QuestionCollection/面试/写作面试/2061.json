Who would you take with you? What activities would you want to do during the trip?", "answer": "I would love to go to America. It is a huge country, and there is much to see. It would be great to travel with friends. It would be a lot of fun. I would like to visit New York City to see the Statue of Liberty, Times Square, Wall Street, and do some shopping on 5th Avenue. Then I would like to fly west to Yellowstone National Park. There are hundreds of small lakes, with a stunning mix of colors. It would be great to see all of this.
