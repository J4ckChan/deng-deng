Explain your reasoning.", "answer": "There are real and imagined reasons why people are afraid of making mistakes. The latter is about catastrophising about a future that hasn't happened yet. We are generally social animals, and are affected by where we find ourselves in the pecking order. Low self-esteem, and trauma can make people afraid of being judged, criticised, or even punished. No one is born with low self-esteem, it's handed to them by someone, mostly when they are too young to choose otherwise. The person who is critical of others has made mistakes too, but you'll tend to find they are hardly likely to draw attention to that fact. Most mistakes are inconvenient, and sometimes embarrassing, but we all make them. It's how we learn, and it is important to personal development to be allowed to make occasional mistakes. Some people have an issue with perfectionism which others may say it a rejection of other things, or a need for more control. This does not mean all perfectionists try to control others. Maybe it is just themselves. Feeling safe in certainty is their refuge, but as we all know life is rarely certain. We all just have to hope for the best, while putting in some effort.\uff08203\u5b57\uff09"}, "msg": "\u8bf7\u6c42\u6210\u529f\uff01"}
