What do you think would be good about living there? What would be challenging about living there?", "answer": "The city is totally different from where I am living in Sydney, which I have read about in a novel recently. Sydney is a coastal city while I am living in an inland city. And the fundamental difference is that Sydney is located in the southern hemisphere with opposite seasons. Walking along the uncrowded beach with a typical Australian coffee would be pleasant. From the novel, Sydney is also a multicultural city where I would have the opportunity to visit galleries and museums about various themes. However, language would become the major challenge if living there since English is the publicly spoken language in Sydney. (105\u5b57)"}, "msg": "\u8bf7\u6c42\u6210\u529f\uff01"}
