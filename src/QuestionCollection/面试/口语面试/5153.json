How would it improve the community if everyone had it for free? How would life be better for your family?", "answer": "In my opinion, all gyms should be free for residents. The main reason is that making gyms free of cost can help attract more people come to gyms and take physical exercises. As a result, people can improve their overall health. Also, if everyone is healthier and becomes more vibrant, it means that our quality of life is improving. For example, my family members will be much happier if they can go to the gym for free and do some physical exercises. As a consequence, they will start to live a better and happier life.
