Provide reasons to support your opinion.", "answer": "In some cases, clothes can tell a lot about a person. A person's clothing can give you clues into the type of job they have (for example, uniforms or business suits) or what they do for various activities (for example, exercise clothing). However, one has to be careful not to stereotype people based on their clothing. For example, I have had female friends that dress on the \"sexy\" side, giving the wrong impression to some men, but she actually quite conservative and intelligent. I have also known people who refuse to purchase clothes from anywhere but discount stores (such as Walmart or K-Mart) and are very financially well off. People dress the way they do for numerous reasons. Judging people based on their clothing can lead to misinterpretation.\uff08128 \u5b57\uff09"}, "msg": "\u8bf7\u6c42\u6210\u529f\uff01"}
