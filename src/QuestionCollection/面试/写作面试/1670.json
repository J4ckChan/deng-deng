Explain your reasoning.", "answer": "Some people contend that students should just follow a set course of study. While, in my view, students should have a say in their course content. The main reason is that enabling students to choose which modules they take, allowing them to specialize and pursue their specific interests, will eventually tailor a generally interesting course to their individual passions and allow them to take increased responsibilities for their own learning. In fact, student choice does remain an extremely positive feature within some courses. Whereas, a structured course may not appeal to the interests of some students, so there will be less inspiration, motivation, and engagement from students. \uff08107 \u5b57\uff09"}, "msg": "\u8bf7\u6c42\u6210\u529f\uff01"}
