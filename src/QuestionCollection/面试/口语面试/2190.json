What resources did you use that were helpful? How can you use what you learned in the future?", "answer": "If I have to recall the last test that I had to study for, I'll tell you this. It was the last couple of weeks of the semester in 2016, and I was in the final year of my bachelor's degree. During this period, I was rather busy as I had to complete my final year project while getting ready for final year exam simultaneously. On the very first day I realized that I had to make a proper timetable for both works. Otherwise it would be highly likely that I lose either final year project or the final exam, which both were equally important for completing my degree. The resource I used was excel. I used it to create the study plan I was going to stick with. Though I spent few hours to make that plan, it was really helpful for me to manage both tasks without getting much stress. I learnt that a good plan prior to the commencement is essential for a successful project, and I believe this will help me in my future career. Even though I had a plan and timetable for my works, I had to work 15-18 hours per day with few hours' sleep. Some days I felt that I was going to suffer from shock or even die of tiredness. But after having a short interval of break - a hot shower usually served the purpose - I was able to reduce my stress down to certain level, and eventually I went through those bleakest time throughout the course. During the shower, I went on YouTube to play music, which I would strongly recommend other students who have to study hard for their examinations, as listening to music really helps you relax.\uff08291 \u5b57\uff09"}, "msg": "\u8bf7\u6c42\u6210\u529f\uff01"}
