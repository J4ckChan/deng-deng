She is looking at a white tablecloth with some patterns. It seems the store is outdoor, and there are many other visitors outside the store. This reminds me of an experience in the past. I travelled with my family to a town near Sydney last year. It was a heritage town where you can buy all kinds of things in the market. There were a lot of people walking into one particular shop that sells cloth. I was also attracted by the cloth it sells because the patterns are truly aesthetically appealing. Therefore, I bought a tablecloth just like the one in this picture.", "photo": "https://cdn.51ddedu.com/images/590659415967801344.jpg", "difficulty": 3, "difficultyName": "\u96be\uff08120\u4ee5\u4e0a\uff09"}, "msg": "\u8bf7\u6c42\u6210\u529f\uff01"}
