Why do you think people do this anyway?", "answer": "When it comes to one thing that I think is a waste of time is scrolling through social media on smartphones. The first and foremost reason for that is it can easily steal away all my valuable time when I am trying to work on something more important, such as an assignment or a job. No surprise here. And it's easy to understand why people are spending hours scrolling through social media on their phones \u2013 the social media applications on smartphones people are using nowadays are just remarkable. They allow people to do a great number of things. For instance, I am bombarded throughout the day with social media notifications \u2013 my posts got commented on, I got tagged by someone, updates on my friends\u2019 activities, etc. Because of these social media applications, I have become so addicted to my phone that I cannot help but to check it every now and then. It has, without a doubt, become an indispensable part of me. However, scrolling through social media is such a bad habit that I need to break."}, "msg": "\u8bf7\u6c42\u6210\u529f\uff01"}
