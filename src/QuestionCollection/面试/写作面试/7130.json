What is the issue, what would you like to change, and why?", "answer": "I would like to change the bad situation in our environment, which can be illustrated by air pollution, water pollution, and soil pollution. With the development of modern technology, human beings have enjoyed the benefit of this development, but there are several serious issues that need to be focused on. One of the most serious issues is environmental pollution. For example, nuclear power was used to provide power to factories. However, in Japan, Fukushima nuclear power station was damaged by an earthquake and tsunami, which caused a devastating natural disaster to our environment. unfortunately, the negative influence is still increasing. Thus, I would like to call for attention from the public and invite people to donate money for protecting our environment. Moreover, I will personally plant some trees in the desert in order to make our planet become better. All in all, I think we need to focus on environmental pollution and take some measures to change the bad situation. (160 words) "}, "msg": "\u8bf7\u6c42\u6210\u529f\uff01"}
