Before I heard this lecture, I used to think that lectures were all about telling jokes to make the audience laugh. But after I watched one of the TED performances on a TV program about one year ago, it really blew my mind. I never thought that a lecture could change boring subjects, such as social and political issues, into a thoughtful and creative show. It was this TED show that completely changed my perspective about lectures. I think this is what made this lecture stand out among all the TV programs. It has the ability to talk about very serious and controversial issues in a way that can connect with normal people. Therefore, I was super impressed by the TED lecture. \uff08150 \u5b57\uff09", "options": [{"content": "Who gave the speech?"}, {"content": "What was the topic of the speech?"}, {"content": "Were you impressed?
