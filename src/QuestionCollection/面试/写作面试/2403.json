What is the one thing that you remember most? How could the experience have been more enjoyable for you?", "answer": "The last time I had dinner with my entire family was fifty-five days ago as of today. I have to admit it makes me sad to think about it. Especially now, I realize it will never be the same again. We used to eat together every night, my parents, my sister, and I. We would talk about our days, about schools, about the latest superhero movies\u2026 everything. Then I went abroad for five months, and naturally, my parents and sister adjusted to life without me. When I came back for a month, we had to get used to each other again. The thing that I remember the most was that they automatically cooked for three, set the table for three, and did everything else together with the three of them. I was like a guest in the place I call my home. The experience could have been more enjoyable for me if my family didn't treat me like a guest.\uff08161 \u5b57\uff09"}, "msg": "\u8bf7\u6c42\u6210\u529f\uff01"}
