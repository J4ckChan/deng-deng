On the top of the sign, there is the name of the church \"RIVER FALLS BAPTIST CHURCH\" in capital letters on a brown board with white edges. There is also one sentence following at the bottom part, \"what is missing from ch ch\" with the character \"U\" and \"R\" missing from the words \"church\". It welcomes more people to the church by actually expressing \"you are missing from the church.\" This is a very interesting sign compared to other normal signs on the street. Nowadays, a sign with a unique character is more impressive than others full of information. This picture reminds me of another sign of a church that attracted me before. That is a simple white and black sign but the sentence on it is meaningful, which is \"Feed your faith and your fears will starve to death.\" (156\u5b57)", "photo": "https://cdn.51ddedu.com/images/477110230237319168.jpg", "difficulty": 3, "difficultyName": "\u96be\uff08120\u4ee5\u4e0a\uff09"}, "msg": "\u8bf7\u6c42\u6210\u529f\uff01"}
