Honestly speaking, I have never made a cake before, but I am going to give it a try this December when my mum's birthday comes because I promised to make her a birthday cake by myself last year. To maximize the likelihood of success of it, I started watching videos of cake-making on the internet one month in advance. I even consulted my friend Leon who is pretty good at making cakes. Then I bought all the ingredients I needed and borrowed a mixer from my neighbor because I was only going to use it once. Now, all the preparations have been done, and my mum's birthday is just around the corner. Let's hope everything goes well.
