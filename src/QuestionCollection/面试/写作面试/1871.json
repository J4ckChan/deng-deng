Where were you, and how was the experience? Do you prefer listening to live music or recorded music? Why?", "answer": "I like pop music very much. The tune gives me energy. I went to see Jay Chou\u2019s concert in Nanjing last year. He is one of the most popular singers in China. I felt really touched when we all sang together with him in the stadium. Speaking of live music or recorded music, I do not really have a preference. It depends on who is playing. Usually, recordings are much cheaper; the voices are better. However, live performances are exciting, especially when the artists talk to the audience, and everyone cheers and claps. It can create some fresh feelings.
