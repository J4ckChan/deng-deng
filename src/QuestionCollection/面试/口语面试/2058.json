How do you think knowing it would benefit you? What can you do to learn this hobby or skill?", "answer": "I would like to learn skiing as it is interesting. Since it is a sport, it can also benefit me in terms of my physical health and mental health. In order to learn this skill, I need to go to snowy mountains to learn from a coach and keep on practicing. I will keep in mind that keeping alert at any time is important, because skiing is a pretty dangerous sport. It is like surfing. In surfing, you have to be aware of any possible circumstance that will happen and know all the measures to deal with accidents. It is also exciting to ski, as we can blend into the nature and find a way to co-exist with the nature rather than fight against it. I believe in the end I will acquire this skill and really enjoy it. (139 \u5b57)"}, "msg": "\u8bf7\u6c42\u6210\u529f\uff01"}
