Explain why the gift was so significant to you.", "answer": "I have received numerous gifts in my life, and among them, the most memorable one was the laptop that my father gave to me when I was 14 years old. After being promoted to grade six in my school, I got admitted to a computer training center and learned some basic computing. Even I really admired my friends to have their own computers, I did not ask for one. On my 14th birthday, my father told me that he had something special for me. I opened the box and found it was a computer! As a young child, that was a long-expected gift my father gave to me, and it's the best present till now. I know it was not easy for my father to buy me this computer from his financial condition, but still, he sacrificed his other joys to make me happy. That was something truly special.
