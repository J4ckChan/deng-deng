What do you like most about the genre? What is your favorite story in this genre, and what makes this story interesting?", "answer": "Among all the genres of film or literature, historical drama is definitely my favorite. Some historical dramas focus more on how to recreate the original scenes of a certain period, while other dramas tend to combine some fictional factors with history. For example, it may talk about a college student, who likes researching history, and occasionally travels back to ancient times and has a magical experience.   My collection of historical dramas is ranging from stories in ancient Chinese dynasties to European kingdoms. The Kangxi Dynasty is a historical television drama that I keep watching for more than three times. It depicts the lifetime of a legendary emperor on how he was dedicated to developing a country from military, agriculture and business aspects. The fantasy costume and grand setting specifically designed make me more involved into that drama.  While learning history, I can also feel the relations and feelings among characters, such as the pressure in royal family and trust between the emperor and generals.
