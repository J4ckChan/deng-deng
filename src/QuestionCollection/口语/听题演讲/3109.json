If someone invites a person to a birthday party, a wedding ceremony, or a baby shower, the invited guest always brings gifts. We often buy gifts whenever someone invites us to their house even if this is just a social visit. Thus, gift-giving is a part of our tradition. I must mention here that during Christmas time, people exchange gifts and cards more than any time of the year.
