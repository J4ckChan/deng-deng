What did this person contribute to society that improved life for others? What can you learn from his or her example?", "answer": "Martin Luther King is one of the most famous civil activity leaders in the history of America. I used to think that civil right was far-reaching and abstract to me, although there were quite lots of discussions around these topics in China. A couple of years ago, I firstly knew him through watching his speech \"I have a dream\". In his speech, he mentioned his dream and goal of achieving racial equality. As a leader, Martin Luther King guided American people to avidly join and support the civil rights and movements. He struggled for people's rights of freedom, equality and wellbeing. He also fought against racial prejudice and violence. Martin Luther king is a fabulous leader and I learnt to respect others' rights and treat people equally from his example.
