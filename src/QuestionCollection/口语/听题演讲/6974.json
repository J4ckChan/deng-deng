Einstein once said: \u201cLife without playing music is inconceivable to me. I live my daydreams in music. I see my life in terms of music... I get most joy in life out of music\u201d. And as it turns out, Einstein was onto something: many studies show a correlation between musical training and academic success, in both children and adults. Learning to play an instrument stimulates the brain, improving functions like memory and abstract reasoning skills, which are essential for maths and science. Therefore, I would love to learn the violin just like Einstein.", "referenceText": "If you could learn to play one musical instrument, what would it be, and why?", "referenceTranslate": "\u5982\u679c\u4f60\u80fd\u5b66\u4f1a\u4e00\u79cd\u4e50\u5668\uff0c\u4f60\u60f3\u5b66\u4ec0\u4e48?\u4e3a\u4ec0\u4e48?", "difficulty": 1, "difficultyName": "\u7b80\u5355\uff08100\u4ee5\u4e0b\uff09"}, "msg": "\u8bf7\u6c42\u6210\u529f\uff01"}
