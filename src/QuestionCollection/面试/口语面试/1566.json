Provide reasons to support your opinion.", "answer": "I don't think I would feel too good about a computer grading my essays as a computer could not measure reasoning, adequacy of evidence, good sense, ethical stance, convincing argument, the meaningful organization in your essay. Even though teachers take much more time to give back feedback, the feedback is more meaningful as they could understand the reasoning of the essays much better. I believe a computer would be able to give me effective feedback, but it wouldn't have been as effective as teachers' feedback.\uff0885 \u5b57\uff09"}, "msg": "\u8bf7\u6c42\u6210\u529f\uff01"}
