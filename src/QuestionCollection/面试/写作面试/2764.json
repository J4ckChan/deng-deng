Explain your reasoning.", "answer": "Every family has a distinct way they work together to solve problems, achieve goals, and relate to one another. Just as business culture is created by default or intentionality, so is a family's culture. There are many strict rules in my family, like do not talking while eating, and can no not eat anything in the bedrooms. One of all these things about my home culture that I wish to change is, \"Children are not allowed to sleepover in a friend's house.\" I believe sleepover is an excellent way for children to experience things like new foods and cultures \u2013 and maybe even a completely different way of living, and it also helps children build independence. Sleepovers can enable children to learn new skills \u2013 for example, packing clothes, getting ready for bed without mum and dad being around, and overcoming separation anxiety. Without parents there to rely on, children are forced into doing more things for themselves \u2013 whether that's asking for a drink or just figuring out where the bathroom is.
