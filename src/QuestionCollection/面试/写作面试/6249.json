Others believe that this can be an unhealthy behavior. What is your opinion about this? Use your personal experience and observations to support your point of view.", "answer": "Recently there has been a heated debate about posting photos and other social updates on social media. Some people think it is an unhealthy behavior, while I think it is beneficial. Some people hold the opinion that releasing their private photos and behaviors by mobile phone will affect the normal life of others. However, I think it is everyone's right to post photos and information on mobile phones. I think everyone has the right to share their life as long as they abide by the law and do not make radical comments. In addition, I think social media is also a good means to publicize values to some extent. Healthy content leads to health. Thus, instead of worrying about whether people should be allowed to post photos on their phones, it is better to do more online policing to support healthy content and create a healthy environment."}, "msg": "\u8bf7\u6c42\u6210\u529f\uff01"}
