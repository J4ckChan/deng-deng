What makes this activity ideal for a rainy day? Why do you enjoy this activity?", "answer": "I like watching movies on rainy days the most because it is the best time to turn family room into our personal theatre, find a movie the whole family will like, and settle in with a blanket and coffee table full of snacks. Watching movies with family is ideal for a rainy day because everyone is cooped up inside and relaxed. Besides, some films are very entertaining and provoking, which makes it a fun project that can bring us even closer together. \uff0882 \u5b57\uff09"}, "msg": "\u8bf7\u6c42\u6210\u529f\uff01"}
