How do you plan to meet this goal? How will acheiving this goal benefit you?", "answer": "I am motivated to earn enough money to make sure that I am able to afford a normal life in the future. I plan to invest in the stock market and, in the meantime, work hard. Such a philosophy of investment is critical even if people have little money because, without forward-thinking and insights into the future, people can never live a stable life. Making such investment and working hard will benefit me in terms of my financial status and a deeper understanding of financial knowledge, which will prove to be useful in the future. In conclusion, people must have an idea of how to manage their assets and think forward.\uff08111 \u5b57\uff09"}, "msg": "\u8bf7\u6c42\u6210\u529f\uff01"}
