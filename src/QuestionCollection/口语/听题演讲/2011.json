Decide how clean I want my house to be and how much time I have. This will help me decide how to set up my cleaning schedule. Be honest with myself about what I can do, how much time I have, and how motivated I am feeling. Secondly, I will make a checklist and a plan of attack. Know which rooms I plan to start and finish my cleaning in (generally back to front door works best). This will help expedite the process and ensure I am not duplicating my efforts, especially if more than one person is involved in the cleaning. Then, I will dust each room, including the topsides of all the furniture, undersides of shelves, and all handrails, as well as picture frames, TV screens, and knickknacks. To get rid of fingerprints, dampen a microfiber cloth with warm water. After that, I will go through the house, strip and remake beds, and neaten any pillows or furniture blankets. Brush furniture surfaces with a vacuum extension as needed. Finally, I will clean the bathroom and kitchen. Spray cleaner on tubs, sinks and toilets. Then, in the kitchen, wipe down the inside of the microwave and cabinet and appliance doors.\uff08207 \u5b57\uff09", "referenceText": "How do you clean your home?", "referenceTranslate": "\u4f60\u600e\u4e48\u6253\u626b\u5bb6\u91cc\uff1f", "difficulty": 3, "difficultyName": "\u96be\uff08120\u4ee5\u4e0a\uff09"}, "msg": "\u8bf7\u6c42\u6210\u529f\uff01"}
