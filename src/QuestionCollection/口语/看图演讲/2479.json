Apparently, the two children are in the middle of fierce competition as the facial expression of one of the kids is rather serious. I guess he wants to win desperately, and he will spare no effort to defeat the other kid. In the background, there are a group of people watching the fight, and most of them are adults, which makes sense as there are supposed to be adults in place to supervise the entire process in case any incident happens. Adults are meant to keep a close eye on the young competitors, should they get injured or the situation gets out of control during the competition. Some of the adults are clapping their hands as if the kids have made a nice move. They are having the event outdoors, and it is probably in an Asian country as can be told by their race. The village they are in does not look well-developed. \uff08173 \u5b57\uff09", "photo": "https://cdn.51ddedu.com/images/477110152927907842.jpg", "difficulty": 2, "difficultyName": "\u4e00\u822c\uff08105~115\uff09"}, "msg": "\u8bf7\u6c42\u6210\u529f\uff01"}
