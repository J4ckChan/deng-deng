Provide reasons to support your opinion.", "answer": "One of the biggest questions surrounding self-driving cars isn\u2019t a technological one; it is philosophical that self-driving vehicles are safer than human-operated vehicles? It\u2019s not something for which there\u2019s an easy answer. From my point of view, self-driving vehicles are more reliable than human-operated ones. According to the news report from China Daily, in 2009, Google launched its self-driving project, which focused on saving lives and serving people with disabilities. In a 2014 video, Google showed blind and elderly riders climbing into its custom-designed autonomous vehicles, part of the company\u2019s plan to \u201cimprove road safety and help lots of people who can\u2019t drive.\u201d In these testing videos, its vehicles have been in dozens of crashes but caused no serious injuries due to its safety self-driving system. Now there are dozens of autonomous vehicle companies testing their self-driving vehicles on the streets, but with minimal reports of injury. As there are now more and more vehicle companies are joining in the competition, it will help to improve the self-driving technology in a great deal. So in the near future, we can see more self-driving vehicles on the street with fewer injury reports. (192 \u5b57)"}, "msg": "\u8bf7\u6c42\u6210\u529f\uff01"}
