This kind of uniform is specifically made for cooks. And the man also wears a white apron to protect his clothes from getting dirty while handling food. He is looking down at the bowl and smiling as if he is enjoying the work. The food he is handling is yellow and apparently sticky as some of it got stuck on the handle of the spoon. It looks like there is an oven behind him. And I suppose he is going to roast the food later.
