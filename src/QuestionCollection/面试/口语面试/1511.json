Provide reasons for why you think the way you do.", "answer": "As far as I am concerned, groups can't exist without individuals so that the individual is more important. The group should act to preserve the rights of the individual, but the individual should act to further the betterment of the group. A group is made up of numerous individuals. There was a famous quote that stated, \"A country is only as good as the people that live in it.\" The same concept here too. A mass of individuals makes a group; therefore, the singular individual is way more important than they might think. The individual needs to be strong, or the group will never be strong. The individual has to be able to support themselves and go their own way because if they rely on the group, then they will never live on their own. That's why I believe that the individual is more important than the group.\uff08148 \u5b57\uff09"}, "msg": "\u8bf7\u6c42\u6210\u529f\uff01"}
