Some may argue that computers have made life more complex and stressful. While there are certainly valid viewpoints, on the contrary, I personally believe that computers have made people's life much easier and more enjoyable. First of all, it is an indisputable fact that computers can largely increase work efficiency. This is because computer software can free people from repetitive work which was time-consuming in the days preceding the invention of computers. Apart from that, it is commonly acknowledged that, by using computers, life gets much easier. That is to say, computer-aided programs allow people to carry out highly sophisticated work with a high level of accuracy. To put it in a nutshell, considering all the factors above, we may safely draw the conclusion that computers have brought tremendous positive changes into people's life.
