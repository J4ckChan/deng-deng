Do you have a certain celebrity that you admire? What do you like about this person and their work?", "answer": "People can be interested in all kinds of famous people. However, the famous person I am interested in is Amy Winehouse. Amy Winehouse was born in London in 1983. She was a jazz singer and songwriter. She started writing songs when she was 14, and later, she became famous in her 20s. Her albums became very popular, and she won many awards for them. She was an outstanding artist. However, she passed away in 2011, when she was only 27. Nevertheless, she was never forgotten. She was and still is an icon for many people. I first knew Amy Winehouse in 2018, through one of her most popular songs \u201cBack to Black\u201d. I was impressed by the style of her music and the lyrics she wrote. Back then, she had already been gone for seven years. Later, when I read articles about her, I found that she had lived a miserable life. Being in the spotlight and under scrutiny, all the time has made her overly stressed, which is one of the reasons why she died young. I wondered how she wrote all these amazing lyrics, which seem easy, but one can never come up with them. And I was also amazed by the chord combinations used in her songs. Overall, that\u2019s why I was so interested."}, "msg": "\u8bf7\u6c42\u6210\u529f\uff01"}
