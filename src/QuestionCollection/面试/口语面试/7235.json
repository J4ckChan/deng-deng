Explain your reasoning.", "answer": "Recently, there has been a lot of discussion about whether to solve problems by yourself or ask others for help. Some people believe that asking for help from others is the best solution. However, I think it is best to solve my own problems by myself. It seems that asking for help from others is transferring one's own problems to others, but in fact, the person who really wants to solve the problems is himself. If we encounter similar problems next time, we can't guarantee that someone will always help. Therefore, the most fundamental way to solve the problem is to rely on yourself. After analyzing the reasons, the best way is to work hard to find a solution and improve your ability. \uff08123\uff09"}, "msg": "\u8bf7\u6c42\u6210\u529f\uff01"}
