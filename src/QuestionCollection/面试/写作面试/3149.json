Give reasons to support your opinion.", "answer": "The competitive spirit is a central element of human nature. Competition is not inherently bad. In fact, it can be incredibly fun. However, competition can hold us back from achieving our greatest potential because it is inherently divisive. There can only be one winner. Collaboration, on the other hand, is all about progressing as a whole. There is no winner unless the entire group crosses the finish line together. While a competitive work environment drives results, the way it drives them is by being fear-driven, overworked, and individualistic. Collaborative environments also drive results, but by way of positivity, teamwork, and creativity. Collaboration is bigger than one person. It's a culture. Any staff member, department, or organization should be encouraged to prioritize collaboration over competition. This is because a collaborative culture promotes a better workplace where everyone seems happy, inspired, and genuine. This culture operates under the philosophy that, \"we're great\". For this group the competitor lies outside the company. Accountability to a set of shared core values and to the company mission inspires people to do their best work.
