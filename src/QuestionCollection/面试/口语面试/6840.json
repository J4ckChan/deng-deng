Explain why you would want to change it, and give an idea of how it could be changed.", "answer": "When it comes to the one thing about school that I would change if I could, giving students the freedom to choose their teachers would be my choice. This is because students have personal preferences just like any of us. They might like different teachers based on different reasons. And we all know that students only learn from those who they like. If they don't like the teacher, they learn nothing. Therefore, this change can help improve learning outcomes. Talking about how it could be changed, schools can give students a trial class so that they can compare and contrast each teacher and make their decisions. This way, students are more active in their learning."}, "msg": "\u8bf7\u6c42\u6210\u529f\uff01"}
