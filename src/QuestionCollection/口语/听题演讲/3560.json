The first reason why people participate in spreading malicious gossip is that they are doing this to hurt those whose popularity, talents, or lifestyle they envy. For instance, celebrities, such as actors and singers, suffer from malicious gossip from the public. Nowadays, people can just type letters and make comments online so that this gossip can be spread worldwide. Another reason could be that people who are gossiping want to gain attention temporarily while divulging a piece of gossip. Due to the online platform, it is impossible to trace who publishes the malicious, so they have no fear at all. Moreover, sometimes, people are under the pressure that they must spread the gossip to become part of the group since the others are all spreading it. But we must realize that the gossip we spread without careful thinking could directly or indirectly lead to harm to others.
