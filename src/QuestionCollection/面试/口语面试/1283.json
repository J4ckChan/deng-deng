How would most students respond if this activity no longer happened? What activity or event do you think should replace it and why?", "answer": "I personally believe our curriculum is set by professionals and is trustworthy. Therefore, the decision should be up to the research and policymakers. I am satisfied with most of the school activities, and if I have to say what should be eliminated, I would say physical exercise. I am aware that physical exercise is critical to keep us healthy, both mentally and physically. However, it is unnecessary to be a part of school activity because we have enough time to exercise after school. Schools should focus on academic performance and teaching actual knowledge. If physical exercise is removed, most students will be relieved because it is exhausting to do exercises. After exercising, we are not able to concentrate on other classes because we are tired. I think giving us a nap at noon could better utilize the time allocated to PE so that we can refresh our mind and get going in the afternoon. (158 \u5b57)"}, "msg": "\u8bf7\u6c42\u6210\u529f\uff01"}
