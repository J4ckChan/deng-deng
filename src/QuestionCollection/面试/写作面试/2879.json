Why should this skill be taught in elementary school? How would knowing this have helped you or made your childhood easier?", "answer": "When it comes to a skill that little kids should learn in elementary school, the first thing that jumps into my mind is social skills, and there are several solid reasons contribute to this. Developing social skills in children prepares them for a lifetime of healthier interactions in all aspects of life. Social skills are an integral part of functioning in society. Displaying good manners, communicating effectively with others, being considerate of others' feelings, and expressing personal needs are important components of solid social skills. Good social skills ensure better peer relationships when children grow older. As students develop social skills in school, hence it becomes a part of their behaviours, which helps them in interaction with people from different sectors. Children who have strong social skills are more easily to make friends with others and are proved to be more successful than those who do not. \uff08147 \u5b57\uff09"}, "msg": "\u8bf7\u6c42\u6210\u529f\uff01"}
