Why or why not?", "answer": "Many people believe that following a schedule that is set by someone else is the easiest way to accomplish things. However, I am more inclined to create my own plan because it suits my own needs and accommodates my own style of doing things. For instance, when I need to prepare for a test, I usually set up a plan for myself according to my usual bedtime and wake-up time. This way, I can make sure that I am energetic when I need to sit down and prepare. Therefore, I can focus and do things more efficiently which might not be possible if I follow schedules set by others."}, "msg": "\u8bf7\u6c42\u6210\u529f\uff01"}
