Some want to save up some money to buy a luxury car while others want to travel to a few countries. Well, I also have a short-term goal, and that is to set up a workout routine for doing some daily physical exercise. Well, I have been carrying this thought inside my head that I would need to work on my physical fitness for almost a year, but I haven\u2019t managed to do it yet either because I have been too lazy or have been too busy. But, the time has certainly become a bit more serious about my health and fitness, mainly because I am spending plenty of time at my office, which makes me gain weight. After all, sitting on a chair for a significant part of the way without any physical activity, in the long run, is a recipe for disaster as far as your health is concerned, especially if you do not strictly control your diet. Besides, my age is also not on my side because the older I become, the more difficult it will get to get rid of the extra weight I gain. At least, my doctor thinks so when he suggests getting rid of my extra weight. Anyway, I know that setting up this workout routine is not going to be easy because I am not exactly a very organized person. Besides, the responsibilities and the current work schedules I have at my job won\u2019t exactly allow me to set a fixed workout routine unless I become more aggressive and innovative about it. In order to set up this workout routine, first, I need to cut my nap time as well as my regular sleep time, if possible. Then I would also need to reduce the time that I sometimes use for socializing purposes with my friends. Besides, I would also need to be more efficient at my work so that I don\u2019t have to spend too much time on a specific task or assignment. \uff08347 \u5b57\uff09", "options": [{"content": "What is it?"}, {"content": "How long have you had this goal?"}, {"content": "How difficult will it be to fulfill it?"}], "difficulty": 2, "difficultyName": "\u4e00\u822c\uff08105~115\uff09"}, "msg": "\u8bf7\u6c42\u6210\u529f\uff01"}
