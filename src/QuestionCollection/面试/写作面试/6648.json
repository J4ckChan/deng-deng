Why do you think it helps you to be more productive?", "answer": "I am more productive when I have only a single task to focus on because multitasking is distracting. Multitaskers may feel more distracted than people who focus on one task at a time. This makes sense when you consider that, by habit, multitaskers constantly refocus on a new task, effectively distracting themselves from their original assignment. Some research suggests that multitaskers are more distractible, and they may have trouble focusing their attention even when they're not working on multiple tasks at once. Other research shows that while there may be a connection between multitasking and distraction, that link is smaller than originally thought and varies quite a bit from person to person."}, "msg": "\u8bf7\u6c42\u6210\u529f\uff01"}
