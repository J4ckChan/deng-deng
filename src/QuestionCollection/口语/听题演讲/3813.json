That is to say, people nowadays are interested more than ever primarily in making money. The goal of making a lot of money obviates the need for people to develop a meaningful philosophy of life. As far as I am concerned, the rising tide of materialism should be stopped due to the following reasons. As people become more materialistic, their wellbeing, including good relationships, autonomy, sense of purpose, and the rest, diminishes. Materialists tend to use possessions as a yardstick of success and seek happiness through acquisition rather than sharing and giving. If our brightest young people are overwhelmingly money-minded when they go to college, they will highly likely become indifferent to and irresponsible for their families and society as a whole. There will be enormous declines in altruistic interests and social concerns. For instance, helping others, promoting interracial understanding, protecting the environment, and participating in community-action programs. For a better world to live in, I urge our people to change the tide of materialism. (175\u5b57)", "referenceText": "Should we try to change the tide of materialism?
