Explain your reasoning.", "answer": "From my perspective, not all lying is wrong because there are also white lies which are from good considerations. The most reasonable point for my argument is that sometimes when people are lying, they are trying to minimize the effects caused by the cruel truth. For instance, before the entrance exam of the university, some parents may choose not to tell their children that they are going to divorce. From the parents' perspective, the most important task for their children is to pass the entrance exam, so they decide to tell this lie just to minimize the negative effects caused by the cruel truth. Moreover, in daily life, some lies are insignificant and do not harm anyone's interest, such as 'it is a tasty cheesecake' when the cheesecake is just plain. It is not easy to define which statement is absolutely right or absolutely wrong in actual world so we cannot judge decisively whether it is a lie.
