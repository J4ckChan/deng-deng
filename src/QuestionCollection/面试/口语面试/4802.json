Why is this activity fun for you? How can this activity benefit you or others?", "answer": "When I have some free time, I like to go hiking. I recently joined a hiking club where a group of us will meet on a particular trail every Sunday morning and hike together. It's a great workout and has been an excellent way for me to meet new friends. It is also fun because I can clear my mind while embracing nature, breathing fresh air and appreciating the magnificence of nature. This kind of temporary relief recharges me to full and helps me stay focused for the coming week. I try to have a healthy lifestyle. Considering how much time we spend sitting in work, I try to move as much I can while I am not working. Hiking is my way of staying healthy, and so far, it's been working great. It's greatly beneficial in a range of aspects, and I have persuaded many of my friends into hiking with me every week. With an increasing number of members, our hiking activities become even more fun. Hiking serves as a great opportunity to expand networks and enrich life experience."}, "msg": "\u8bf7\u6c42\u6210\u529f\uff01"}
