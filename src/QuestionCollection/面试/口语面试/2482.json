What makes this subject unenjoyable for you? How would you change the subject to make it more enjoyable?", "answer": "My least favourite school subject is mathematics. I prefer humanity subjects and physics in scientific subjects. During the free periods, all I want to do is to read the work of great authors and perfect my writing. I find the principles of physics to be intriguing and straightforward, but when it comes to mathematics, either algebra or geometry, the content is too difficult for me to participate in and prepare for. I just can't get my head around it. How on earth can a certain number be transformed into a completely different one? And the rather sophisticated formulae have always been a massive obstacle that I guess I can never overcome. My math grades weren't always that low, they were okay when I was in primary school, but since year 9 they started to fall gradually year by year as the content got increasingly complicated. Unfortunately, mathematic is a mandatory subject, so I will have to try my best to complete the course. If something could be changed to make mathematics more enjoyable, I would like anything relating to advanced level mathematics to be eliminated from the subject. \uff08188 \u5b57\uff09"}, "msg": "\u8bf7\u6c42\u6210\u529f\uff01"}
