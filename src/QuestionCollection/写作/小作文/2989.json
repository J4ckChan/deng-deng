Describe the experience. Include specific details.\"", "answer": "Last year, I and my friend took a trip to New Zealand. At the famous Piha Beach, we experienced the most beautiful sunset ever. The Piha Beach is famous not only as a surfing paradise but also for its beautiful sea view trail, with virgin forest on one side and coastline on the other. We were lying on the beach and I closed my eyes to experience it with my soul and not just my eyes. I could hear the waves hitting the shore, trees \"speaking\" to each other, sea birds cooing for food. The moisture and warmth in the air gave me chills. The sand beneath my feet flowed away slowly. As the waves hit my feet, I opened my eyes to witness the magnificent sunset happening right in front of me. The big orange ball slowly went down and down and it set into the horizon, making the sky absolutely stunning and leaving behind so many colors. The red sky became sailors\u2019 delight. The seagulls flew before the sunset bidding the sun goodbye. As the white ball rose, the tides became higher. The bright orange sky turned into pitch black in an hour. \uff08198\u5b57\uff09", "difficulty": 1, "difficultyName": "\u7b80\u5355\uff08100\u4ee5\u4e0b\uff09"}, "msg": "\u8bf7\u6c42\u6210\u529f\uff01"}
