How did you feel about being in that group of people? What is one positive thing or one negative thing about being in large crowds?", "answer": "The sense of belonging has long been a strong desire of human beings from a very early age. I suppose it is an inherent part of humanity. There is a saying \u201cNo one is an island,\u201d which reinforces my belief. As far as I am concerned, this saying holds true in every aspect of people\u2019s life. During the last two years of my university study, I was privileged to be admitted into a large community called Peer Network. It is a volunteering program established to welcome and help newly enrolled students during orientation weeks and throughout the first few weeks of each semester. I encountered this community when I was a freshman who was about to start his university journey in 2013. I am highly grateful for those who had helped me when I hardly knew anything about the surrounding environment. Now that I am a member of the community. I sense a feeling of belonging in that we share one common goal, which is to make the university a better place for both students and staff by supporting and helping others in need. And I get a sense of accomplishment via helping others. Being a Peer Networker not only facilitates my self-actualization but largely expands my social network, too. These are the most amazing advantages I get from being in this massive crowd. \uff08228 \u5b57\uff09"}, "msg": "\u8bf7\u6c42\u6210\u529f\uff01"}
