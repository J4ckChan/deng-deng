When an ecosystem has been dramatically changed by human activities - such as agriculture, oil and gas exploration, commercial development, or water diversion - it may no longer be able to provide the food, water, cover, and places that wildlife need to survive. Every day there are fewer places left that wildlife can call home. A bulldozer pushing down trees is the iconic image of habitat destruction. Other ways people directly destroy habitat include filling in wetlands, dredging rivers, mowing fields, and cutting down trees. Much of the remaining terrestrial wildlife habitat has been cut up into fragments by roads and development. Aquatic species\u2019 habitats have been fragmented by dams and water diversions. These fragments of habitat may not be large or connected enough to support species that need a large territory where they can find mates and food. The loss and fragmentation of habitats make it difficult for migratory species to find places to rest and feed along their migration routes. Pollution, invasive species, and disruption of ecosystem processes (such as changing the intensity of fires in an ecosystem) are some of the ways habitats can become so degraded that they no longer support native wildlife. \uff08225 \u5b57\uff09", "difficulty": 2, "difficultyName": "\u4e00\u822c\uff08105~115\uff09"}, "msg": "\u8bf7\u6c42\u6210\u529f\uff01"}
