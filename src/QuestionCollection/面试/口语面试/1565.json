How did you resolve the argument? How did the experience impact your relationship, and what did you learn from it?", "answer": "I was in my early university days when this disagreement took place and I had totally different ideas with my best friend Rose about how to finish an assignment. Rose didn't prepare for it and only copied answers online. I tried to convince her that the whole concept of the assignment was not to copy-paste contents from any website and encouraged her that she can write excellent essays on her own. However strong the disagreement was, our friendship was stronger, and Rose yield to follow my lead to finish this assignment. That's how the dispute was resolved and we were all happy about that. Honestly speaking, the disagreement was so strong, and at a time, I thought that's going to harm our friendship. But in reality, Rose was a smart and understanding girl, and she accepted my proposal to resolve this issue, and we became closer than before. I learned that we should stick to the right thing and help our friends to improve. (170 \u5b57)"}, "msg": "\u8bf7\u6c42\u6210\u529f\uff01"}
