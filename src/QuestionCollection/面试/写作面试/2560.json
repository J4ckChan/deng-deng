Describe the skills, knowledge and other qualities that a person should have as an adult.", "answer": "When it comes to the core value of being an adult, I suppose it would be the responsibility. Being an adult essentially means that you need to assume certain responsibilities, especially for things you had done since you are now a lot more mature than you were when you were a kid. An adult is supposed to understand the effect of his or her action on the rest of the world. Therefore, you are supposed to behave appropriately. This requires you to think twice before acting. It also means understanding how your surroundings affect you. If you are an adult, then you know how to make choices based on your preferences, beliefs, and abilities\u2014choices that allow you to succeed in the world. To become an adult, you need maturity and experience\u2014and certain knowledge and skills. To take responsibility for your life and your decisions, you can no longer try to shift the blame when things don't go right. It would help if you stopped worrying about whose fault the problem is, or what someone else should do about it, and start focusing on what you can do to fix the problem or deal with the changes that this problem may cause. Taking responsibility puts you at the choice and allows you to choose how to respond to life's challenges. You will move into the driver seat of your life's journey.\uff08234 \u5b57\uff09"}, "msg": "\u8bf7\u6c42\u6210\u529f\uff01"}
