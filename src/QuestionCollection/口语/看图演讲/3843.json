She is looking through the window as if there is something interesting happening outside the room. From the look of the room, we can tell that she was trying to clean up the mess on the floor with a red broom. Apparently, someone had broken the vase, leaving the plant, soil, and debris all over the floor. In the room, there are a small round table and two chairs which had been moved against the wall to make space for the cleaning process. On the yellow wall, there are some stickers and car plates.
