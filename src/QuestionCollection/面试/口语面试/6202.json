Do you agree or disagree with this statement? Use examples from personal experience and observations to support your perspective.", "answer": "I think experience is the most important thing. Students can take teachers' advice as a reference and an awareness, but students can still try them out and see what is happening. Keeping trying can help students develop practical skills and critical thinking. Do they start to doubt questions on why did I fail? Why did I get a different result from the teachers' results? And so on. Or they can just partially take the teachers' advice and try out the rest themselves."}, "msg": "\u8bf7\u6c42\u6210\u529f\uff01"}
