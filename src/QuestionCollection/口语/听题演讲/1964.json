Firstly, there are a number of government organizations as well as non-government organizations consistently working on the preservation of wildlife's habitats. Wildlife must have places to find food, shelters and raise their young cubs. Parks, reserves and other open spaces benefit wildlife by providing habitats, while also providing us with great places to visit and enjoy. Programs of those organizations have brought some of these species back from the brink through captive breeding and reintroduction programs. Also, you can always see people in uniform that represent their organizations. They are there to give pedestrians a brief on the crisis wildlife in the country are facing, and persuade people to donate, even if the donation is as small as several dollars per week, which is just the cost for a cup of coffee, still it would make a difference in the long run. Apart from that, to minimise the number of wildlife killed on roads in my country, road signage is being used on most of the country roads. It reminds drivers to be conscious of animal behaviour near roadsides.\uff08190 \u5b57\uff09", "referenceText": "How is the preservation of wildlife and land achieved in your country?", "referenceTranslate": "\u4f60\u4eec\u56fd\u5bb6\u662f\u5982\u4f55\u4fdd\u62a4\u91ce\u751f\u52a8\u7269\u548c\u571f\u5730\u7684?", "difficulty": 1, "difficultyName": "\u7b80\u5355\uff08100\u4ee5\u4e0b\uff09"}, "msg": "\u8bf7\u6c42\u6210\u529f\uff01"}
