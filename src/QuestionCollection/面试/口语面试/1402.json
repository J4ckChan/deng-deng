How would your life be improved if it was not required? How do you think your classmates would respond if it was not required?", "answer": "There are many things being banned by school rules and regulations, and dating is the one I disagree with most. If the restriction is to be removed, my life would probably be sweeter during high school, as I would have already tasted the fruit of love. Dating a gorgeous girl would have significantly relieved the heavy burden of study during those pedestrian school days, especially the bleakest final exam periods. If, by any chance, that was a healthy relationship that she and I have maintained along till now, as I am mature enough, we would probably have seen each other\u2019s families and planned to take the next step \u2013 marriage. Oh my god, there is already all kinds of beautiful scenes of post-marriage life going around in my mind, ha-ha. In terms of my classmates, I suppose the majority of them would have done the same thing as I have \u2013 to temporarily put aside all the frustration resulted from academic performance, and cultivate a relationship with the ones they had been fascinated for a long time, and enjoy the sweetness of love or learn one thing or two from failure. Either way, those school days would have much different, and I bet it is just the change that most of us, as a school kid, would have desired. \uff08221 \u5b57\uff09"}, "msg": "\u8bf7\u6c42\u6210\u529f\uff01"}
