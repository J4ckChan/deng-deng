What do you think they would find? Why would their research be important for people know about?", "answer": "Facial recognition cameras are increasingly being used for control purposes. Whether it is the end of anonymity is a topic that journalists should investigate. It can be found that the facial recognition cameras already come standard in the latest smartphone models: cameras that can recognize faces. In public spaces, too, facial recognition technologies are increasingly in use. Surveillance cameras are being rolled out to help police track down criminals, for example, by automatically comparing the faces of people passing by against photos of criminals from databases. People need to know these findings of the investigations, as it can be an invasion of people's privacy and it's people's right to know if they are being monitored. The facial recognition technologies are being used in the business sector, for example, a software program is currently being developed to scan the faces of customers inside a store and match them up with their profiles on social media. Those who linger over a certain product at a retail store could start receiving digital ads for that product as a result.\uff08176\u5b57\uff09"}, "msg": "\u8bf7\u6c42\u6210\u529f\uff01"}
