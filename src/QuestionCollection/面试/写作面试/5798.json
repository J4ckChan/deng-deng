Provide reasons to support your opinion.", "answer": "From psychology, a dream is meaningful in reflecting a person's mental status. Sometimes people are so stressed, and at night, people would dream about nightmares because of the pressure. Sometimes people miss close friends or relatives who have already passed away, people would dream of them during the night. In addition, from the other view, a random dream can trigger creativity to produce ideas. So, the dream is extremely informative. By studying the dreams, we would find a high correlation between the virtual dream and the recent experiences in reality. Studying dreams can help people release pressure and sorrow, and can be applied to mental studies in psychology."}, "msg": "\u8bf7\u6c42\u6210\u529f\uff01"}
