What do you think this dream means? Would you hope this dream comes true? Why or why not?", "answer": "A couple of weeks ago, I had a dream. It was a rather horrible dream because I dreamt about the death of a good friend of mine whom I admire the most. I couldn't remember the exact cause of his death, but the scene of the funeral is still in my memory. I felt a strong sense of emptiness inside me deeply. I woke up all of a sudden in the middle of the funeral. It was a nightmare for me. I had never experienced a thing so depressing, so heartbreaking before. When I shared that dream with that friend, he asked me jokingly if I wanted him dead so bad in real life that I even dreamt about his death. We then both laughed at the silly dream. Fortunately, it was merely a dream, nothing more than that. So, both of us stayed worry-free. But the reason why I had that dream remains a mystery.
