Explain your reasoning.", "answer": "People at my age often are not willing to try new things as they are afraid of change. It is difficult for them to get out of the comfort zone and explore new things either because they are already satisfied with the current situation or because they fear the high cost of failing to achieve goals in new settings. We can present them with fruitful outcomes of changes and encourage them to change step by step and once a time rather than to drastically engage in new events. Therefore, they can either be interested or slowly accept the new reality, and it causes no pain during the process.\uff08108 \u5b57\uff09"}, "msg": "\u8bf7\u6c42\u6210\u529f\uff01"}
