Provide reasons to support your opinion.", "answer": "Nuclear weapons are a modern invention that I think has done more harm than good. Once used, nuclear weapons will bring devastating destruction and sorrow. In the United States, an all-out effort for making atomic weapons began in late 1942. In the years after World War II, many countries were involved in the further development of nuclear fission for multiple purposes of nuclear reactors and nuclear weapons. So far, two nuclear weapons have been used in the course of warfare, both by the United States near the end of World War II. These two bombings resulted in the deaths of approximately 120,000 people in Japan. Today these areas are no-go zones with radioactive activity still prevalent. The lasting effects of these attacks highlight the destruction nuclear weapons can wreak, but countries all over the world worryingly still sit on secret stashes of them.
