But overprescribing them has resulted in the development of resistant bacteria, that don't respond to antibiotics that may have worked in the past. Taking antibiotics for colds and other viral illnesses not only won't work, but it can also have dangerous side effects \u2014 over time, this practice helps create bacteria that are harder to kill. Therefore, it is of critical importance to prevent the overuse of antibiotics. One must always bear in mind that: Antibiotics can only treat bacterial infection if taken for the full amount of time prescribed by the doctor. Talk to pharmacists if you're unsure about the use. The medicines take time to work, so don't expect to feel better after taking the first dose. Antibiotics must be taken for the full amount of time prescribed by the doctor. Otherwise, the infection may come back. Don't take antibiotics longer than prescribed. Do not use leftover antibiotics or save extra antibiotics for next time.
