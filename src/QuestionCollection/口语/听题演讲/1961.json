In my view, healthcare should will freely available. First of all, a nation should take actions that save the most lives and protect the most people. Free healthcare saves lives and protects people and can lead to less inequality. Poorer segments of the population tend to be more prone to illness and disease. They have less money to spend on healthy, organic food items. They also have less time to exercise, less access to health education, and are more likely to work in jobs that carry a high risk of illness or injury. In a for-profit health system that requires citizens to pay for the services they use, lower economic classes end up spending a much higher percentage of their salary on healthcare costs. They are less likely to have health insurance that can lighten the financial burden, leading to a greater financial gap between the lowest and the highest economic classes. In addition, free health care prevents financial exploitation. If you know nothing about cars and you go to a mechanic for assistance, you are more likely to be ripped off. The same logic applies to healthcare. Doctors study for many years to become experts in human anatomy and illnesses. It is unrealistic to expect the general public to know enough about medicine to protect themselves from financial exploitation. Therefore, the public will always be at a disadvantage. Some people will inevitably exploit this disadvantage for financial benefit. Considering the factors above, I am convinced that medical services should be free of charge.\uff08283 \u5b57\uff09", "referenceText": "Many people believe that healthcare should be freely available for everyone.
