What activities do you enjoy the most and why? What do you do on weekends that helps you to prepare for school on Monday?", "answer": "The weekend is normally a period for me to relax and get ready for school on Monday. Typically, I will start my Saturday with a brunch, where I can enjoy a cup of coffee with soft pancakes. After that, I would like to go for a walk along the beach with my close friends or families. Breathing the fresh air and relieving my eyes, I can definitely get rid of the hustle and bustle in weekdays.  Also, the conversation with friends of families are always encouraging and inspiring, which I share my study and life with them. If that is a rainy day, a film time at home with snacks is also a great option. A feast is a highlight for weekends but sometimes I may get frustrated by the long line out of the restaurant. At weekends, I have more spare time to spend on my interests, such as playing guitar and skateboards. The relaxing time is necessary for me to take a rest so that I can start a new week with energy.
