He is drizzling salt onto the meat on the BBQ grill. He is outside in the garden so I guess he is having a party with family and friends. It is a sunny day as you can see from the sunshine on the trees. This reminds me of my birthday this year when my friends came to my house and celebrated with me. That night, we had a BBQ as this is convenient and delicious. We had pork, chicken, beef, and lamb, a bit of everything. It was a memorable birthday.", "photo": "https://cdn.51ddedu.com/images/590675178497777664.jpg", "difficulty": 3, "difficultyName": "\u96be\uff08120\u4ee5\u4e0a\uff09"}, "msg": "\u8bf7\u6c42\u6210\u529f\uff01"}
