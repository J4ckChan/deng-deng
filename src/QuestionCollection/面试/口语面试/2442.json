How did your help affect your friendship? How did helping someone else make you feel?", "answer": "Well, we all need help at some point in time in our lives. I also received help in many occasions and help others too. When I help others, it makes me happy in the way that it gives me a sense of fulfillment. Today, I am going to talk about the last time when I voluntarily helped one of my friends. I helped my needy friend who was my classmate. His name is Wesley, and he comes from a poor family. He didn't have enough money to buy books. And I used to receive a hundred bucks pocket money per week in those days. Usually, I would have spent that money on groceries such as snacks and drinks. However, I decided to help him by giving all my pocket money to him so he could afford to buy the books he needed for the course. I still remember vividly his facial expression. The very moment he received my financial help, he was so touched that he couldn't help but almost cried out. He didn't dare to let me stare at him while he was crying, so he hugged me tightly for a long time. I kept patting him in an attempt to soothe him. Quite a while later, he went to the bookstore to buy the books. Since then, we have been best friends. To be honest, I felt happy at that moment. That feeling was extremely different which I never felt before. I noticed something that could give me more happiness than eating snacks.\uff08255 \u5b57\uff09"}, "msg": "\u8bf7\u6c42\u6210\u529f\uff01"}
