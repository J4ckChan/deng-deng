In my freshman year, I was attracted by the new life in university so that I participated in several extra-curriculum activities. However, I spent only a few time on studying my major courses. Even for the final period, I didn't take the exams seriously, unsurprisingly, I failed one exam. Since it was a fundamental exam, I must pass it to enrol advanced courses. Therefore, my graduation was delayed for one more semester and there is a fail remark in my transcript. This mistake always warns me to treat study and life seriously at any time. In the following studies, I tried my best to balance between study and interests. Moreover, I gradually develop good habits on how to manage time wisely and utilize time efficiently. Although that mistake cannot be corrected, the lesson I learnt from it will benefit me for the rest of my life. (158\u5b57)"}, "msg": "\u8bf7\u6c42\u6210\u529f\uff01"}
