Explain why the answer is so important to you.", "answer": "I consider Lionel Messi as one of the legendary footballers of modern times, if not of all times. If I ever get a chance to ask this famous footballer a question, I would certainly ask him what it was that really motivated him to become such a great footballer apart from the reason of being born in a football-obsessed country. This is because I have long been wondering what the true secrete is behind his great perseverance throughout all these years. Messi is an Argentine Footballer who started his football career at the age of 17 when he joined Barcelona club. Since then, he never really had the time to look back as he kept winning for his club and team season after season with his extraordinary football skills. However, behind his glorious moments on football fields, Messi has devoted a lot more than others can imagine. His great success can not only be attributed to his passion, but his perseverance to overcome physical deficiency as well. From his response to my question, I expect to learn how I can overcome any kind of hardship, either I am experiencing or I should encounter in the future, regardless of its magnitude. I really hope to be genuinely inspired by his great spirit, which would have a long-term benefit on my life. (220\u5b57)"}, "msg": "\u8bf7\u6c42\u6210\u529f\uff01"}
