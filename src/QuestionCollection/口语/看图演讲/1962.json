As we can see from the picture, the man in the middle of the picture is wearing a checked shirt and a yellow t-shirt. He is wearing gloves and jeans. He is about forty years old and he is looking at the camera. He has grey hair and a lot of wrinkles due to the heavy logging work. Another guy wearing a blue hat is cutting trees with tools. They are typical logging workers, who cut down, process, and transports mature trees for logging purposes. They harvest thousands of acres of forests each year. The timber they harvest provides the raw material for countless consumer and industrial products. Logging is physically demanding and can be hazardous. Workers spend all their time outdoors, sometimes in poor weather and often in isolated areas. The increased use of enclosed machines has decreased some of the discomforts caused by bad weather and has generally made logging much safer. The practice of logging ranges from large-scale commercial timber plantations to individuals harvesting fuelwood. While logging is important to regional economies and rural communities, if not managed properly, it can contribute to deforestation and forest degradation. \uff08198 \u5b57\uff09", "photo": "https://cdn.51ddedu.com/images/477110122863136768.jpg", "difficulty": 3, "difficultyName": "\u96be\uff08120\u4ee5\u4e0a\uff09"}, "msg": "\u8bf7\u6c42\u6210\u529f\uff01"}
