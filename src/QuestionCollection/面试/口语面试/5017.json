Provide reasons to support your opinion.", "answer": "In my opinion, it is very important for people to take risks in life because high risks are often associated with high returns. On the other hand, if people are reluctant to take any risks, there might be fewer opportunities for them to grow. For example, Sally is an aqua-phobia. She wanted to go to the beach and see the beach view but she did not want to take the risk that going to the beach might make her condition become worse. Therefore, she did not take the risk and she did not go. As a result, she cannot enjoy the beach view and her condition has not improved.\n"}, "msg": "\u8bf7\u6c42\u6210\u529f\uff01"}
