How has this difference impacted your relationship with him or her? What can you learn from each other because of this difference?", "answer": "When it comes to the biggest difference between my best friend and me, I suppose it is our tastes. My best friend William is a savoury person, while I have an extremely sweet tooth. This is what makes going out to eat so easy between the two of us. He can eat the leftovers I don't want, and I know that I'll never have to fight over the last bite of chocolate cake \u2014 it's all mine. There have been many TV shows I've fallen in love with just because William introduced me to them. I probably never would have even known about them before. Luckily, I have someone who inspires my TV watch list. In fact, he got me into watching the Game of Thrones just by talking about it on social media so much. Sharing music is one of the greatest things ever. I love discovering new music, but it's always so hard to do so on my own. That's why it's fun to have a bestie who has a different taste in music. I can always count on William to introduce me to new tunes. Because of the difference between our tastes, we have forged a rather solid relationship. We learn about the latest trends and decent restaurants, which greatly enrich both of our lives. (218\u5b57)"}, "msg": "\u8bf7\u6c42\u6210\u529f\uff01"}
