The Olympics is a well-known example that brings people together every four years. People have contests together and compete for ranking and medals, and also most importantly, people make friends during the game period. However, there might be some negative consequences of these competitions. Athletes may get injured because they all have strong desires to win. To be fairer, high technology detecting devices will be widely used in the competitions in the future, for example, accurate cameras and sensors will be applied to avoid human mistakes in the game results.", "options": [{"content": "Do you believe they bring people together?"}, {"content": "What are the negative consequences of these competitions?"}, {"content": "How will sports competitions change in the future?"}], "difficulty": 2, "difficultyName": "\u4e00\u822c\uff08105~115\uff09"}, "msg": "\u8bf7\u6c42\u6210\u529f\uff01"}
