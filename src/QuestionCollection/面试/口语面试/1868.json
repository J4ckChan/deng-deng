Explain the reasons for your choice.", "answer": "Well, I believe the best compliment that someone could give me is that \u201cyou always see the bright side (of things).\u201d The reason is that I do often see the bright side of things, and I also need someone to say it when I do not see the bright side sometimes. So this compliment may be a reminder of how optimistic I am even when I may sometimes feel upset. This way, I can adjust myself and face the difficulties again with optimism. If the compliment is from my family of friends, then I will be even more encouraged and motivated because they are the people who know me well, and their compliment is an acknowledgment of my optimism. It will give me a lot of strength and courage to keep it that way. (136 \u5b57)"}, "msg": "\u8bf7\u6c42\u6210\u529f\uff01"}
