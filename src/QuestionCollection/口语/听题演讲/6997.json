Credibility is what constituents value when it comes to an election. If the politician loses his or her credibility, then they are unlikely to win the election. For example, Hillary Clinton lost the election for the US president because she has been lying about her connection to Russia. Although there may be nothing wrong with the relationship between Hillary and Russia, her response to the public was a lie. Therefore, running for public office requires credibility as a basic and necessary qualification.", "referenceText": "What do you believe are the necessary qualifications to run for public office?", "referenceTranslate": "\u4f60\u8ba4\u4e3a\u7ade\u9009\u516c\u804c\u7684\u5fc5\u8981\u6761\u4ef6\u662f\u4ec0\u4e48?", "difficulty": 3, "difficultyName": "\u96be\uff08120\u4ee5\u4e0a\uff09"}, "msg": "\u8bf7\u6c42\u6210\u529f\uff01"}
