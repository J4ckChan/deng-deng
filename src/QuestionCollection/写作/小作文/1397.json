Others prefer to be spontaneous (decide what to do at the last minute). Which do you prefer? Why? Give specific reasons for your answer.\"", "answer": "There is an ongoing debate about whether to plan all our vacation activities or decide what to do at the last minute. While it is possible to claim that being spontaneous gives you a sense of freedom, my view is that we should make plans in advance. There are several solid reasons why planning in advance is considered to be advantageous. Firstly, by doing some preparation, people already have the plan for the day on what to do, what to see, and how they will travel to those places; therefore, they could visit more attractive and unique places during their holiday time. Secondly, a planned holiday would definitely save more budgets. People who planned their holiday time could book airline tickets and accommodations from an earlier period. As a result, they get lower prices for airplane tickets and the hotel's room rate as well. In conclusion, I prefer to have a planned holiday, as I could see more attractive places during that time and save more money. \uff08167 \u5b57\uff09", "difficulty": 2, "difficultyName": "\u4e00\u822c\uff08105~115\uff09"}, "msg": "\u8bf7\u6c42\u6210\u529f\uff01"}
