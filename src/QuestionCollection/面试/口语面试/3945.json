Provide reasons to support your opinion.", "answer": "The freedom of speech and the ability of government to regulate it have been a controversial issue for centuries. Personally speaking, people should be allowed to say what they want, provided they are prepared to accept any consequences for their choice of words. This is because you can't ask to be protected from how people react to your point of view. The reactions of others cannot be controlled. Despite the reaction of others to what you say, it is commonly argued that everyone deserves the right to speak their mind, reject, protest and refuse. Freedom of speech is a fundamental part of art criticism, cultural criticism, and protects the right to protest and fight against what we don't want, and to argue for what we do. We need to have opposing views co-existing with one another to free our minds and challenge us. We shouldn't allow ourselves to let 'political correctness' make us afraid of sharing views that can contribute to critiquing our culture. Freedom of speech is the gateway to being able to question consensus, and to challenge what is being presented as truth. I think it's everyone's right to share their investigations and critiques, to challenge the cultural consensus. (201\u5b57)"}, "msg": "\u8bf7\u6c42\u6210\u529f\uff01"}
