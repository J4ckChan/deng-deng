Describe some ways in which we can determine whether information on the internet is trustworthy.\"", "answer": "The internet provides enormous ranges of information currents. Under this circumstance, differentiating the qualities of information might be challenging. However, there are still handy tips to extract superior information. Firstly, looking for an authority site instead of anonymous sites. Those sites that have accumulated long-term tangible reputation are credited as authority sites. They have been providing reliable information from the past and are seen as most likely to keep providing authorized information in the future. Secondly, comparing across different sources and gathering information holistically. This would avoid the invalidity of a certain information source.\nUltimately, by applying the techniques of searching on authority sites and comparing different sources, we can eventually find trustworthy information on the internet.", "difficulty": 2, "difficultyName": "\u4e00\u822c\uff08105~115\uff09"}, "msg": "\u8bf7\u6c42\u6210\u529f\uff01"}
