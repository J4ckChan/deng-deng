Provide reasons to support your opinion.", "answer": "When it comes to the fairness of computer grading, people's notions vary from one to another. As far as I am concerned, it is fairer for a computer to grade student's school essays. To begin with, computer grading is more objective due to the fact that the grading program is prewritten by the authority. That is to say, a computer can consistently mark all student's essays without any bias or preference. Additionally, the marking criteria used by computer grading is based on the agreement of a group of experts, which means a computer can more precisely and comprehensively mark student's assignments. Due to the reasons outlined above, we can safely draw the conclusion that it would be fairer for a computer to grade school essays. (125\u5b57)"}, "msg": "\u8bf7\u6c42\u6210\u529f\uff01"}
