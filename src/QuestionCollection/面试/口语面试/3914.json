How did you get the courage to try it? What did you learn from this experience that will help you in life?", "answer": "I had never tried skiing before because I was too scared to do so, but I did it anyway last winter. My best friend, William, asked me if I would like to go skiing with him and a group of his friends. I didn't give him my response straightaway. Instead, I had a thorough thought over that plan for a couple of days because I had never skied before, and I hardly knew any of the other people in the group. Finally, I made my mind \u2013 I decided to join them and leave all the concerns behind. I suppose the biggest driver was my will to try playing extreme sports. If, for any reason, I had chosen otherwise, I suppose that I would regret so much. Because I experienced the great fun of skiing and viewed the amazingly gorgeous scenery of the snow mountain. Besides, I wouldn't have met so many amazing people who have taken good care of me and taught me how to ski. Apart from the skiing skill, I also learnt that I should step out of my comfort zone and try things that I haven't experienced before as I only live once.
