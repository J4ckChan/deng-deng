Do you agree or disagree with this statement, and why?\"", "answer": "I totally disagree with this argument. Because in fact, technology saves a huge amount of time in our daily life. I am trying to imagine my life without technology. Without smartphones, computers, cars, washing machines, and so on. It would be a very different world as we all know it today. The fact is all of us rely on technology daily. Whether it is at work, at home, or at school, I know that my family greatly depends on technology, and I am confident that we are not the only ones. And technology also plays a great role nowadays. Everybody has a smartphone, so we can communicate easily. I can hardly imagine a time without television and the internet. We love to watch Netflix and enjoy our quiet family time. We have a fridge, dishwasher, and washing machine, it all helps us get through the day much easier. Technology affects my life in so many ways that it is extremely hard to imagine how much convenience it brings to us.
