What two questions would you ask them? What would you hope to learn?", "answer": "I would like to meet Jack Ma, who was the most prosperous businessman in China because he is charming in terms of his humor and inspiring speech. I have watched all of his speeches and am impressed by some of his quotes, including \u201cToday is hard, tomorrow will be worse, but the day after tomorrow will be sunshine.\u201d If I have a chance to have dinner with him, I would ask: what do you think about the investment in the private education sector in terms of making a profit? And what do you think about the involvement of private equity in the education sector in terms of its interference with the essence of education? I ask these two questions mainly because Jack Ma was an English teacher before he launched a business called Alibaba, which makes him the richest person in China. I would like to know his insights into the relationship between education and business. Therefore, I would benefit from his ideas and can better think of my future research path.
