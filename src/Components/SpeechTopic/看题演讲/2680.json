Yet as we grow up, we slowly become exposed to small \"white\" lies \u2014 those told to keep us from becoming upset or sad. Even as we transition into adulthood, well-meaning lies are often told to shield a person from criticism or added hardship. So it is not always wrong to tell a lie. There are times when a white lie seems to be the least offensive thing to say. For example, someone gives you a gift you don't like. Do you say you don't like it or something such as: \"Thanks for the thoughtful gift?\" However, if every lie told could prevent harm to another person, without any ill-effects, or even can save someone's life, it would make the answer to this question more clear that a lie is definitely worth it. \uff08149 \u5b57\uff09", "options": [{"content": "Is it always wrong to tell a lie?"}, {"content": "Why or why not?"}, {"content": "Would you lie in order to save someone's life?"}], "difficulty": 3, "difficultyName": "\u96be\uff08120\u4ee5\u4e0a\uff09"}, "msg": "\u8bf7\u6c42\u6210\u529f\uff01"}
