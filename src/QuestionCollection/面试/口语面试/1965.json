What made that day special for you? What one part of that day makes you smile the most?", "answer": "My favorite holiday was Christmas and during the last Christmas, I traveled to Australia with my family. It was the first time that I travel abroad with my family and it means a lot for both of my parents as well. We went to Sydney to visit the Opera House and had a great dinner in darling harbor. We saw different culture integrated with each other everywhere of Sydney and the aboriginal performance in circular quay is the most impressive. The most special of the experience is that I did all these things with my family. I am lucky enough to have them with me and we laughed a lot together. I asked someone else to take a photo of my family in front of the Opera House and it was the best moment of the day. I smiled with true happiness and really enjoy the whole experience in Sydney.\uff08150 \u5b57\uff09"}, "msg": "\u8bf7\u6c42\u6210\u529f\uff01"}
