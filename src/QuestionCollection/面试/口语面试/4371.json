What made you laugh or enjoy that experience? Who did you tell about it, and how did they respond?", "answer": "One day, I was getting back from school by bus. The bus was full, but I managed to get a seat. I was so tired, and I rested. Suddenly I heard someone yelling angrily at me \"Hey you, wake up!\" I didn't have the foggiest idea what I did. I was confused. Before I said anything, she yelled as loud as possible by guiding finger toward a young lady who was standing close by my seat. \"Can't you see she is pregnant? Just offer your seat. Don't you know this much of manner?\" I immediately rose up to offer that lady my seat. I was about to explain to that lady that I didn't see her. Suddenly, that lady told me \"You sit.\" and turned back to the girl who was yelling at me \"I am not pregnant.\" It turned out that she was just over-weighted. I couldn't help but began giggling. I told this to my parents, and they laughed out loud. (163\u5b57)"}, "msg": "\u8bf7\u6c42\u6210\u529f\uff01"}
