Provide reasons to support your opinion.", "answer": "When it comes to whether fear is a good motivator, people have different opinions. Some people hold the view that fear may better motivate people to conquer the difficulties. On the contrary, I personally believe that fear is harmful to people. Admittedly, it is commonly acknowledged that people's fear of a certain difficulty can become a powerful motivator due to the fact that fear may push individuals to move the distressful things out of their comfort zone. Nevertheless, it should be pointed out that fear can be harmful to individuals' health condition. That is to say, people's fear may transfer into anxiety or even agony, which can have negative impact on their emotional and physical wellbeing. In addition, it is a fact that fear may hinder people's study and work efficiency in that individuals may inhibit their performance when dealing with things they are afraid of. Overall, it is obvious that fear does more harm than good to people. (159\u5b57)"}, "msg": "\u8bf7\u6c42\u6210\u529f\uff01"}
