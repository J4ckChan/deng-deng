Explain the reasons for your choice.", "answer": "Well, if I were not afraid of failing, I would try another career. I mean I could try something new such as skiing but there is nothing to be afraid of if I am not good at it. But when it comes to a different career, it is definitely something I would be careful with. A new career means a totally different area of knowledge and skills which requires an extensive amount of time to acquire. Nevertheless, with the correct amount of training, having a new career would bring much more into my life."}, "msg": "\u8bf7\u6c42\u6210\u529f\uff01"}
