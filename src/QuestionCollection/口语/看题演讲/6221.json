We were paired by the teacher. At first, we thought this is not going to work as we are both weak at giving a presentation. However, after working together, we started to find a way to do this. I enjoyed collaborating with him because he always makes a plan beforehand and listens to my opinion carefully before he presents his own ideas. We engaged in meaningful discussion and argument about how to do this presentation. The result is a huge success. Therefore, it is important to learn how to collaborate with others.", "options": [{"content": "What did you collaborate on?"}, {"content": "Who did you collaborate with?"}, {"content": "Do you enjoy collaborating with others?"}, {"content": "Why or why not?"}], "difficulty": 1, "difficultyName": "\u7b80\u5355\uff08100\u4ee5\u4e0b\uff09"}, "msg": "\u8bf7\u6c42\u6210\u529f\uff01"}
