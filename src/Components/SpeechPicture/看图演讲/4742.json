The man is naked to his waist and wears a pair of pants and a pair of sneakers. He has got a number of tattoos on the top half of his body. Beside him on the bench, there is a bottle of drink and a bag, which indicates that he probably is having a rest. He is leaning his back onto the wall behind him, looking pretty chilled.
