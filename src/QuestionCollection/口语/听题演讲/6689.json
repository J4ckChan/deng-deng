The court of Chu was rife with corruption, though, and greedy ministers were being bribed by enemies. The loyal Qu Yuan was framed, and the king was turned against him. Driven to despair, Qu Yuan drowned himself in the Miluo River. When locals learned that he had drowned himself, they raced out in wooden boats, beating drums and splashing the water with their paddles to scare off evil spirits and fish, on a desperate search and rescue mission. Therefore, this becomes a tradition on the day that he died.
