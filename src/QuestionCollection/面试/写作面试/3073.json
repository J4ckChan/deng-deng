Provide reasons to support your opinion.", "answer": "As far as I am concerned, taking risks is rather important because of the reasons outlined below. Most socially confident people deliberately learn specific skills. This means, through practice, we can develop better confidence, equipping us with the right skills to take risks. When we feel shy or afraid of something, we can take action to build more confidence. Instead of accepting ourselves as shy persons, we need to summon up the courage to overcome our fears by facing them. In doing so, we will feel more confident outside of our comfort zone. Taking a risk to achieve a goal requires courage to face the fear of uncertainty. No matter the outcome, either way, we grow through the process and become more resilient and confident. Better yet, building those skills helps in taking more risks and improves the chances of achieving future goals. (143\u5b57)"}, "msg": "\u8bf7\u6c42\u6210\u529f\uff01"}
