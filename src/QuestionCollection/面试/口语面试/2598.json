How did you feel about being in that group of people? What is one positive thing or one negative thing about being in large crowds?", "answer": "I remember a time when I was part of a large crowd that it was New Year's Eve. Many people were gathering at the Harbor Bridge and waiting for the countdown and the New Year's Eve fireworks. I felt very excited about being in that group of people, as they were all very cheerful and excited; all of them were chatting, playing, dancing and singing. Everybody was waiting happily for the new year to come. One positive thing about being in that large crowd is that you will see everyone is enjoying their time with friends and families and having a good time. You will experience that people are all very happy and looking forward to the new year, and this kind of happiness would make you feel more excited and waiting for the good things to happen in the coming year.\uff08142 \u5b57\uff09"}, "msg": "\u8bf7\u6c42\u6210\u529f\uff01"}
