How can you improve this area of your studies? Who can you ask for help, and what would you expect to learn from them?", "answer": "One thing that I hope schools can improve someday is some teachers\u2019 pedagogy. Because some teachers\u2019 pedagogy is not as effective and efficient as they thought.  For example, some teachers are outcome-driven and thus they tend to plan learning curriculum solely base on learning outcomes. However, this practice can lead to some downsides. For example, some students might not be interested in the learning outcomes and thus become disengaged in learning. Therefore, these teachers need to improve on their pedagogy, and perhaps, they should prioritize students' interests when they plan the learning curriculum."}, "msg": "\u8bf7\u6c42\u6210\u529f\uff01"}
