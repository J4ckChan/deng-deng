Who would you want to take with you and why? What do you think you could learn on this trip?", "answer": "I would like to visit England and bring my parents with me to enjoy this trip. I want to visit England because, as once the country's first line to defend against invaders, the English coastline these days is a peaceful place where locals and visitors can enjoy more tranquil pursuits. Taking a bracing walk on a windswept pier, eating delicious fish and chips, searching for marine life in rock pools, finding fossils in ancient cliffs, building sandcastles, and dolphin-spotting on picturesque beaches are just some of the activities offered by the English seaside. With these activities, my parents can enjoy the sunshine and swim in the sea at the same time, so that they can be relaxed and enjoy their retirements after a lifelong work. What's more, as my parents never travel abroad, this trip to England would be a new experience for them, not only to see different sceneries from other countries but also to experience the different cultures and delicacy. From this trip, I think I will be more connected with my parents and know more about them, and more importantly, I can learn the value of a family and how to connect strongly with my parents.\uff08199 \u5b57\uff09"}, "msg": "\u8bf7\u6c42\u6210\u529f\uff01"}
