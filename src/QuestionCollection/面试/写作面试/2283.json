How does this quality make him or her a better person? What have you learned from this parent that helps you in life?", "answer": "When it comes to a thing that I like the most about one of my parents, I suppose it would be my father\u2019s masculinity. To me, he is a hero, an ideal father, a benevolent person, and a man of his honor. He is in his 50s now. We live in a family of 4, and he is the head of our family. Though he can\u2019t manage every aspect of our family due to his age, he is still the decision-maker for our family, and every single decision he has ever made involves a high level of sophistication and great kindness towards every other person. I remember him from my early childhood when he used to play chess with me. He taught me many things, including the value of responsibility, honesty, and punctuality. He told me some of his great adventures in his life through stories, and those stories are still inspiring for me. He is a person of his word. He would not talk much, but when he does, it carries unparalleled weights. He is a benevolent person, as I have seen him helping many people in our locality. We never take his love and care for granted; instead, we very much appreciate everything he has done for us. I revere my father for his acute observation and great decisions. I love him and admire him so much that I want to become a person like him. I also express my kindness to the people around me and help them whenever they need a hand. Each time I am assigned a task, I will complete it within the given timeframe and to a high standard. As a result, I earned others\u2019 trust and forged healthy relationships.\uff08292 \u5b57\uff09"}, "msg": "\u8bf7\u6c42\u6210\u529f\uff01"}
