Explain why it was such an important lesson to learn.", "answer": "An important life lesson I have learnt in the last few years is that - you don't need everyone to agree with you or even like you. Most things are considered subjective. They're open to interpretation. There isn't a set way of doing every single thing in life that's always the right way. Because of that, people will differ in their opinions on how to approach something. If you're not doing it their way, you are highly unlikely to please them. It's not worth it to try to please everyone all the time. Not only will you begin to live your life according to someone else's standards, but you'll deplete yourself of any sense of happiness or enthusiasm. Do what makes you happy and what pleases you. As long as you're doing the right things with a good heart, that's all that really matters. (144\u5b57)"}, "msg": "\u8bf7\u6c42\u6210\u529f\uff01"}
