Because money is the universal currency to buy anything you need and want. However, not all people are skilled and knowledgeable enough to secure a full-time job that offers a decent amount of salary. Therefore, they need to look for ways to supplement their income. And most people get extra income usually by working multiple shifts a day and committing to several jobs throughout the week, and some are probably working 7 days a week. I reckon it is rather commonplace for people to supplement their income, particularly those who live in underdeveloped countries, such as north-east Asian countries and African countries, where citizens' living standard is relatively low compared to those living in developed countries. And such a phenomenon is inversely proportional to the maturity of the economic system in a country.
