Members of the group all wear orange T-shirts. The group is designed for the volunteer program where senior university students get elected and trained to help new students during orientation weeks. The volunteer activities involve showing new students the way to their destinations on the campus, answering their questions relating to course enrolment, university life, and so forth. As the transition period from high school or other stages of one's life to university could be fresh and difficult at the same time, it would be really nice to have someone by your side who can help you out. The place our group members met up was the Peer Network office located on level four of the home building while the training took place on level thirty.
