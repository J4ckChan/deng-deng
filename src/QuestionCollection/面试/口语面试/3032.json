What about the film was so memorable? What did you learn from the story?", "answer": "We tend to look for ourselves in our favourite superheroes. They inspire us to take action, to do justice, to stand for what's right. As a woman, I appreciate seeing a female on the front of a Marvel movie poster for a change. Captain Marvel is everything that I admire: determined, strong, just, and willing to be vulnerable. She doesn't let others tell her who she is or what she can do, but discovers those things for herself. Though another character tells her, \"Your emotions make you weak,\" she soon learns otherwise\u2014that women aren't lesser beings and were not created by God to be men's servants or eye candy. We are all one in Christ. The friendship between Captain Marvel and Nick Fury is particularly wonderful, while viewers can also enjoy the usual explosions and fights familiar to the MCU. This is a fun superhero origin story that carries with it a weighty message of biblical truth if we are willing to look. Superheroes who demonstrate mercy, rescue the innocent, and call out injustice are mirroring attitudes that Christ displayed. Captain Marvel is the best of these.
