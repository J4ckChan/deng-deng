How do you think people would react if it went extinct? What would be lost if the animal no longer existed?", "answer": "The ecosystem on our planet consists of a large variety of species that have lived harmoniously for ages. I am convinced that there is certainly a meaning behind every existence, regardless of its size. Each creature has its role on this planet, with some being especially helpful to mother nature.  The bat is all about saving the Earth. The creature of the night is an expert at slaying insects of all kinds, eating up to hundreds an hour. This appetite helps control bug populations and protect crops. Bats are also assisting in medical breakthroughs. Their saliva is used for stroke victims, while their ability to echolocate is being studied to help the blind. Bat guano, while it may be stinky, is one of the best fertilizers to keep the world flourishing. Without bats, our life would be chaotic as too many insects would greatly impact agricultural production. Farmers then would have to use a large number of pesticides, which is terrible for consumer\u2019s health and the environment. The absence of bats in the food chain would lead to a loss of balance in the world. (185 \u5b57\uff09"}, "msg": "\u8bf7\u6c42\u6210\u529f\uff01"}
