At the time, I thought it would be best to continue to complete some of the higher priority projects I was working on. Unfortunately, these projects kept coming and coming, and suddenly we had several high-priority projects. Despite how hard we worked, we missed the deadline. I had to send personal apology letters to the client's representative, saying that I would take full responsibility for the delay. I then spoke with my team and we agreed that we would move our schedules around to work overtime on its completion. Throughout the process, we kept the client up to date and sent over snippets and useable components whenever possible. The project was eventually completed three days after the initial deadline, which resulted in a loss of reputation of our company.
