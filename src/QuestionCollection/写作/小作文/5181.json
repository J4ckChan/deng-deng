Do you support or oppose these plans? Why? Give specific reasons for your answer.\"", "answer": "With the development of automation and industry, more and more factories are built near urban communities. I would never support the plan of building a large factory near my community as this might threaten my community's life quality and even health. People might think that a large factory would help with the local unemployment and boost the regional economy. However, the drawbacks always outweigh the benefits. A large factory means a huge supply of certain products. By producing a huge amount of supply, the factory would need to emit a huge amount of waste gases and chemical sewage during the process of production. This might further lead to the degradation of the local air quality and the heavy metal pollution on the local soil. These are the reasons I oppose the plans of building a large factory near my community.", "difficulty": 2, "difficultyName": "\u4e00\u822c\uff08105~115\uff09"}, "msg": "\u8bf7\u6c42\u6210\u529f\uff01"}
