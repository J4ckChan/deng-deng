Do you agree or disagree? Why? Give specific reasons for your answer.\"", "answer": "I favour the statement that television has distorted communication among friends and family. In the present world, I mean a world full of technologies and achievements by the human race, not only the scientific and technological subjects have been changed but also most communications, relations and behaviours have been modified based on the new technologies. For example, television can be mentioned as an instrument that has affected and occasionally destroyed most relationships especially communications among families and friends.
