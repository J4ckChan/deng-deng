It is the equivalent of Christmas in most western countries. While there are certainly a large variety of decorations that Chinese people put out for the Chinese New Year, two things are essential. The first is the Fu character, which represents good fortune in Chinese. The second is the New Year couplets on which people write good wishes for the coming year. Both of them are red and the Chinese characters on them are written in either black or gold color. This is because red generally symbolizes flourishment in Chinese culture.
