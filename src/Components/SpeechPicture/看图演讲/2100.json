As we can see from the picture, the journalist who wears a green shirt is holding a professional camera, and he is trying to capture some important moments of the swimmer. I think sports photography really requires skill and timing. It's a very technical genre of photography. As we can see from the picture, the swimmer is wearing a red swimmer hat and a tight swimming suit. There are a lot of audiences at the back of the swimming pool. I guess it must be a swimming competition and the winner has just landed. The winner is about 20 years old and he is really masculine. For him, when he won the Swimming Championship, it was the start of what would become an extraordinary career and the beginning of a history-making journey for a swimmer. Also, there are other candidates swimming in the pool and they are trying their best. \uff08159 \u5b57\uff09", "photo": "https://cdn.51ddedu.com/images/477110131453071360.jpg", "difficulty": 1, "difficultyName": "\u7b80\u5355\uff08100\u4ee5\u4e0b\uff09"}, "msg": "\u8bf7\u6c42\u6210\u529f\uff01"}
