One reasoning behind this is that human behaviors might cause some wild animals to become endangered. For example, the panda is considered a type of endangered animal and if some people take a panda home and raise the animal in an inappropriate way, it might lead to the death of the panda. If more people continue to behave the same, more pandas might die. As a result, pandas as a type of wild animal might die out. ", "referenceText": "Some people capture wild animals to keep for pets.
