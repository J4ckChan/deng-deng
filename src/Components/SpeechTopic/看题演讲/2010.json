It is a 1979 Mandarine Chinese Song by Teresa Deng, who was widely regarded as one of the most famous singers in China and was regarded as having one of the most beautiful voices in the history of Chinese music. In China, Teresa was among the earliest singers people got to know after the reform and opening-up. I like the song very much because it reminds me of the happy time when I listened to this song with my mom in my childhood. That was the happiest time of my life. We both like this song because of Teresa's sweet voice and its beautiful melody. \uff08126 \u5b57\uff09", "options": [{"content": "What is the name of the song?"}, {"content": "Who sings it?"}, {"content": "Do you like the song?"}], "difficulty": 1, "difficultyName": "\u7b80\u5355\uff08100\u4ee5\u4e0b\uff09"}, "msg": "\u8bf7\u6c42\u6210\u529f\uff01"}
