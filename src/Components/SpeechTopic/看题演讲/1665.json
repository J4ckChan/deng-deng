But here I would like to talk about a foreign culture which I really like. This is the celebration of a special day which is Thanks Giving day Day. My cousin came from the US last year and she told me about this day. There is no particular day for Thanks Giving day and the date can be differed by state. This day is celebrated with a lot of happiness and enthusiasm. I feel that this culture is interesting because it gives people an opportunity to thank their family and friends. In our country, we don't celebrate Thanks Giving day, but we thank our family and friends every day.", "options": [{"content": "What culture is it?"}, {"content": "When were you first exposed to this culture?"}, {"content": "How does that culture compare to your own?"}], "difficulty": 1, "difficultyName": "\u7b80\u5355\uff08100\u4ee5\u4e0b\uff09"}, "msg": "\u8bf7\u6c42\u6210\u529f\uff01"}
