I go to Decathlon to buy sportswear as this is a store that is specialized in outdoor sports. I often go to Costco to buy groceries as it is inexpensive compared to other stores such as Woolworth and Coles. Both of the stores have different goods to sell but they have something in common. For example, the products are not too expensive and of high quality. This is surprisingly rare nowadays. The idea of low price low quality does not apply to both of the stores. Therefore, I can't say which one is better or worse because they are both the best in their own area.", "options": [{"content": "What do you usually buy at each place?"}, {"content": "Which one is better?"}, {"content": "Why?"}], "difficulty": 2, "difficultyName": "\u4e00\u822c\uff08105~115\uff09"}, "msg": "\u8bf7\u6c42\u6210\u529f\uff01"}
