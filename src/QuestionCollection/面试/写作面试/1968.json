Du Fu is the greatest poet in Chinese history. He lived through the violent fall of China's brilliant Tang Dynasty. During that time, the capital city was captured by the rebel armies, and floods and famine wreked the country. Du Fu was forced to fleet, taking his family with him as refugees. However, out of those horrible events, he produced what we call the greatest poetry in Chinese language. For centuries, Du Fu has been admired and appreciated by both children and adults, not only because of his poetry, but also because of his spirit.\uff08114 \u5b57\uff09"}, "msg": "\u8bf7\u6c42\u6210\u529f\uff01"}
