Use examples from your personal experience or observations to discuss your position.", "answer": "There are advantages and disadvantages to using books, movies and TV shows to learn about different cultures. Benefits include easy access to books, movies and TV shows. With the development of communication technology, watching movies and TV shows and reading books online is easy. Hence, one can easily find information about a culture through the internet. Disadvantages might be the lack of communication in these mediums. Books, movies or TV shows are merely input, taking away the chances for communication. Therefore, one cannot negotiate knowledge with a native speaker, leading to a loss of opportunity to learn some nuances in the target culture."}, "msg": "\u8bf7\u6c42\u6210\u529f\uff01"}
