She showed her intrinsic enthusiasm for computers from a very young age. She started to be insisted on programing languages since then and did a lot of practice. She was born in 2002, but she is already so proficient in everything about information technology and she is better than most university students. She won the Silver award of Computer Science in Asia when she was 17. Practices and innate talent make her so good at it, and I learned algorithms from her."}, "msg": "\u8bf7\u6c42\u6210\u529f\uff01"}
