As we can see from the picture, two gravediggers are working in the yard. The guy on the left side of the picture is digging holes. He is wearing a blue shirt and blue jeans. He is about thirty years old, and he has a shovel in his hand. There is a trolley behind him, so he can move all the soil to somewhere else. Another guy is resting at the moment. As we can see from the picture, he is leaning on a tombstone, wearing a green shirt and jeans. He has white hair and white skin. I guess he is around forty years old because he is a little bit choppy. As we can see from the picture, there are more than ten tombstones in the picture. This place is in a mountainous area with plenty of trees and flowers. \uff08149 \u5b57\uff09", "photo": "https://cdn.51ddedu.com/images/477110114273202176.jpg", "difficulty": 3, "difficultyName": "\u96be\uff08120\u4ee5\u4e0a\uff09"}, "msg": "\u8bf7\u6c42\u6210\u529f\uff01"}
