Who gave it to you and how did you thank him or her? How did this experience impact your relationship with the person?", "answer": "A few months earlier, I was having a chat with my boyfriend, and I told him how badly I was getting bored these days. As we're in a long-distance relationship and it is difficult for us to see each other very often. Two days later, I got a message from him, it was written \"I've been working on this from the past two days, and I slept at 7 am yesterday. I hope you like it! :)\". But there was nothing! I texted him asked him about it, and then he sent me a link. I opened that link. My heart was pumping louder, and then the magic began. The background music of my favorite track started playing. In the middle of the screen, a heart started using thin threads and filling itself with colors like red, pink, orange, blue, purple. It was awesome! On the left-hand side, there were two pictures, one above another. The above one was me, while the below one was him. And this wasn't over yet. There was a background text which started typing as soon as the link was open. It typed \"How a simple hi at stairs ended up with endless talks. Sometimes it's hard to find words to tell you how much you mean to me. Many times, I don't say anything at all. But I hope someday you'll understand, having you is what I live for.\" I was in tears. This was undoubtedly the best surprise that somebody ever did for me. I thanked him for inviting him to a fancy restaurant on our anniversary and giving him my handmade gift. Since then, our relationship has become more durable and reliable, and we have already planned for our weddings.\uff08288 \u5b57\uff09"}, "msg": "\u8bf7\u6c42\u6210\u529f\uff01"}
