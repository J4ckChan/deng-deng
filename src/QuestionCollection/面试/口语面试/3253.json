Explain your reasoning.", "answer": "Sometimes what we experience in dreams is so real that we can even remember when we wake up and it reflects what burdens us in daily life. To be more specific, if the deadline of an exam is approaching, we tend to dream of getting up late so that missing the exam or leaving the materials at home. This is because we keep worrying about the exam, and even when we sleep, we still make our nerves tense. And family member who has passed away always appear in our dreams, which is an expression that we still miss them and cherish the memory. In other cases, the dream may be in contrast to reality. For instance, in real life, we may not have the courage to try the skydiving, but we may find ourselves are enjoying the air and excitement of skydiving in dreams. This can tell us that, in our deep inner world, we are really eager to do these activities. (162\u5b57)"}, "msg": "\u8bf7\u6c42\u6210\u529f\uff01"}
