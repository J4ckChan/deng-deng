I love to go there when I feel I need some time on my own. It's only about a fifteen-minute walk from my home. There's a small river that runs across the city. And at that particular place, the river is quite narrow and there are some rocks by the riverside. I find the sound of the water rushing over the rocks to be very soothing. Sometimes I can sit there for hours just listening to the sound of the water flowing along. People who live nearby come to swim in the river when it's hot. That's how I first found it when I was a kid. I came here with some friends and we used to swim in the afternoon and relax by the river during the vacations from school.
