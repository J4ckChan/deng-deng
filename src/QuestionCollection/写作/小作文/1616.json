There was a time when we had to do a group assignment together with a tight schedule. When working on the formatting and layout, we had a dispute. I felt like I was always being criticized for things beyond my control. I sat down with her and talked about ways that we could improve our communication and our work. After having that calm, productive conversation, our relationship improved significantly, and we even became close collaborators on several other assignments. \uff0890 \u5b57\uff09", "difficulty": 1, "difficultyName": "\u7b80\u5355\uff08100\u4ee5\u4e0b\uff09"}, "msg": "\u8bf7\u6c42\u6210\u529f\uff01"}
