How did one-on-one assistance help you learn the subject better? How can you use what you learned to help others who struggle with the same subject?", "answer": "The last time that I received tutoring is when I was preparing for the English test which is required by the universities abroad. I have arranged this one-on-one assistance with a tutor who has passed the exam with a high mark. Instead of attending lectures where all the materials are the same for all the students, tutoring can help me to learn the materials that suit me the most. Moreover, my questions can be solved directly by raising them during the tutorials. After passing the exam, I have shared my experience and thoughts with friends who are preparing for it.
