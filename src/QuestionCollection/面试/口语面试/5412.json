Explain the reasons for your choice.", "answer": "Doing exercises is the thing that motivates me to get up early every morning. Before having any food in the morning, I look so much more fitter than in the evening. If I look into the mirror in the morning, I can see my perfect abs and triceps without any fat. Now it is also a perfect time for me to start some aerobic exercises before breakfast such as running, jogging, or jumping the rope. And then I will cook breakfast as a little rest for the aerobic exercises and also as a protein supply. Then I wait for 30 minutes because I don't want to suffer appendicitis, and I will continue to do some anaerobic exercises to shape my muscles."}, "msg": "\u8bf7\u6c42\u6210\u529f\uff01"}
