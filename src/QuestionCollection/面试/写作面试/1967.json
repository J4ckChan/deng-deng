What could teachers do to make this easier for all children? How did you overcome similar struggles when you were younger?", "answer": "Young children in school often face bullying from elder children either because they have not enough courage to report to teachers or because teachers treat it as simple quarrels between students. It is most important for teachers to realize that bullying should not be tolerated at all and should be identified and seriously dealt with once the incident is reported. This way, students will be reassured to report bullying. When I was younger, such matters are not emphasized and are often buried after anything serious happened. Fortunately, I was not bullied to a severe extent yet such issue should be seriously dealt with by implementing certain law to protect our children. \uff08111 \u5b57\uff09"}, "msg": "\u8bf7\u6c42\u6210\u529f\uff01"}
