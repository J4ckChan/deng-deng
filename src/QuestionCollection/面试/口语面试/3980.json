Why do you think people who do this job are not paid enough? How would you justify increasing their salaries?", "answer": "When it comes to the underpaid profession, the first one that comes into my mind is the nurse. It is an indisputable fact that nurses play vital roles in taking care of patients. They are using their professional expertise to facilitate the healing process when people get sick or injured, assisting surgeons to carry out the surgery, and so forth. Apart from doctors, nurses help ensure people's health both physically and mentally. Many of them have to work night shifts to serve existing and potential patients. Without nurses, taking surgeries and hospitalization would be horrible experiences for patients. Nonetheless, nurses aren't getting paid enough, especially those whose job involves heavy-duty and requires them to stay 100% focused throughout the shift. Nurses are assuming massive responsibility as one simple mistake could trigger deadly consequences. In this sense, I reckon nurses should be paid more.
