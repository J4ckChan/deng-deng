Why is that place so memorable? Do you think it would be as memorable to other people?", "answer": "Bondi Beach is a very popular place for people in Sydney to go for swimming and other recreational activities. I visited this famous beach in 2007 when I first came to Australia with my family. It was a very memorable and exciting trip for me because we do not really have many beautiful beaches and seaside places in my hometown. The whole experience was new for me, and I absolutely loved it! I guess this place also leaves a long-lasting memory for people whoever visited it because there are a lot of excellent bars and cafes around the beach. \uff0899 \u5b57\uff09"}, "msg": "\u8bf7\u6c42\u6210\u529f\uff01"}
