Include specific details in your answer.\"", "answer": "I still remember the time when I first came to Australia for education, I was forced to adapt to a totally different environment where I had to speak another language. At the very beginning, I could not even understand a word because I had such a different accent from my local classmates. Moreover, I could not fit into the local groups because I did not find a sense of belonging due to my different background. Fortunately, I met my best friend. She was born in Australia but she still considered herself as Chinese identity. She introduced me to the Chinese community embedded in Australian society and taught me English. I adapted the society because of her help, and she is also very happy about it.", "difficulty": 1, "difficultyName": "\u7b80\u5355\uff08100\u4ee5\u4e0b\uff09"}, "msg": "\u8bf7\u6c42\u6210\u529f\uff01"}
