At that time, people did not have mobile phones, and thus they could only make calls via telephones or send handwritten letters. Both of the means were rather inefficient, especially with the letters because it would probably take several days, or even longer if the letter was to be delivered overseas before it could reach the recipient. The messages contained in the letter would probably have already been out of date by then. However, now with the invention of mobile phones and the Internet, people are able to communicate with others instantly by sending emails online or making phone calls wherever they are. In cases where visual contact is required, people can even conveniently make video calls, which was undreamt of 100 years ago. For this reason alone, I would not like to have lived during that time.
