Provide reasons to support your opinion.", "answer": "I believe giving some animals the same rights as humans are impractical and somehow naive to think about that. This is mainly because animals are fundamentally different from humans in terms of intelligence, and our moral standards require otherwise. Firstly, animals do not understand what the rights are, and it is meaningless to waste our already scant resources on ensuring animals' rights. Having said so, animals do have rights, but it is not the same rights as humans. For example, they deserve to have their natural environment. Secondly, if someone faces the choice of either saving one animal or one person, then moral standards will almost certainly require one to keep the person rather than the animal. Then what is the point of talking about the same rights for the animal? Therefore, animals cannot and certainly will not have the same rights as humans. It is rather a profound question than a practical matter.\uff08154 \u5b57\uff09"}, "msg": "\u8bf7\u6c42\u6210\u529f\uff01"}
