First of all, students should give themselves enough time to study, and do not put the study plan on hold until the last time. Making a study schedule can help you write down how many assessments you will take and how many days you will take the exam so that you can organize your study plan accordingly. Second, try to get rid of all distractions and make sure you feel comfortable. Some of us need everything in order to concentrate, while others need to thrive in a more chaotic environment. Think about what works for you and take the time to do it well. It can also be made into a mind map. Visual aids are very useful for the brain during review. At a time point closer to the examination, these explanations on the mind map and knowledge structure system will be condensed into one page. Then write down in this short format how you connected the knowledge points in these topics, which can help you quickly recall all the contents you need to know in the exam. These are effective methods that I highly recommend.", "referenceText": "Describe some effective ways to prepare for an exam.", "referenceTranslate": "\u63cf\u8ff0\u4e00\u4e9b\u51c6\u5907\u8003\u8bd5\u7684\u6709\u6548\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "difficulty": 1, "difficultyName": "\u7b80\u5355\uff08100\u4ee5\u4e0b\uff09"}, "msg": "\u8bf7\u6c42\u6210\u529f\uff01"}
