In the middle of the picture, two workers are standing in a red crane to repair the damaged wall on the outside of a building, and one of them is an older man who wears a whiter shirt, the other one is a middle-aged man, and he wears a yellow shirt with blue pants. On the right side of the picture, there is a potted flower on the balcony that has the color red and purple. On the left side of the picture, there is a white street lamp. Also, from this picture, we can see that the building is in grey, from which we can assume that this building may have been built for many years, and it is reasonable to have some exterior wall fell off, which needs to be repaired. In conclusion, this picture is fascinating and helps me to get a better understanding of building repair.
