The movie was about Matt, a struggling executive. He found his world going upside down the moment his estranged father\u2019s nurse showed up in his office unexpectedly. Matt\u2019s father, who was a well-acclaimed journalist, was diagnosed with terminal cancer, and his last wish was to go on a road trip with Matt \u2013 from New York to Kansas. He wanted to process his last Kodachrome film rolls before closing his lab forever. One of the reasons why I liked this movie is because it is road-trip-oriented. The movie speaks largely about relishing the moments of life and never regretting anything. When it comes to movies based on a theme of a road trip, the journey is highlighted well than the destination. And that is exactly what this movie celebrates as well. Right from the presentation to the lessons, the movie is enthralling and hooking till the end.", "referenceText": "Describe the plot of a movie you have seen.", "referenceTranslate": "\u63cf\u8ff0\u4e00\u4e2a\u4f60\u770b\u8fc7\u7684\u7535\u5f71\u7684\u60c5\u8282\u3002", "difficulty": 2, "difficultyName": "\u4e00\u822c\uff08105~115\uff09"}, "msg": "\u8bf7\u6c42\u6210\u529f\uff01"}
