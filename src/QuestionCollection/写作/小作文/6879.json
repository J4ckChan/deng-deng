These include the ability to be independent in dealing with problems. For example, I grew up in the countryside and a few months ago, I encountered the issue of losing my job. I immediately started looking for a new job by myself and finally found an even better-paid job. I attribute this to my growing environment because I learned how to live by myself and solve problems by myself. Therefore, being independent is an advantage of growing up in rural areas.", "difficulty": 1, "difficultyName": "\u7b80\u5355\uff08100\u4ee5\u4e0b\uff09"}, "msg": "\u8bf7\u6c42\u6210\u529f\uff01"}
