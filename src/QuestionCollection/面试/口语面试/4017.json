Provide reasons to support your opinion.", "answer": "As far as I am concerned, parents do hold different expectations for their children based on sex. Boys engaging in physical play while girls are generally taught to avoid physically demanding activity is something that I believe has always been around in society. This develops the stereotype that since boys are genetically stronger, they are more capable of doing physical activity to the point that it seems girls cannot do the same, which is just not true. Girls tend to be more emotional because they are allowed to be more emotional. On the other hand, boys are generally not taught to be emotional because being emotional is something that is typically not seen as \"manly.\" Overall, the available evidence leads to the conclusion that parents have different standards and ambitions for their daughters than they do for their sons.
