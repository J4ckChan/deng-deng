If you could only give them one food to represent your country, what would you choose and why?", "answer": "The food that I would like to introduce to my lovely foreign friends when they come and visit Korea is kimchi. As a traditional fermented Korean side dish, it is more than just vegetables prepared with a variety of seasonings. Kimchi embodied the identity of a nation. Kimchi has become a symbolic resource for all Korean people. It's a feature that makes Korean cuisine unique. Therefore, in order to help my foreign friends to gain a better understanding of Korean culture, I would like to introduce them to kimchi."}, "msg": "\u8bf7\u6c42\u6210\u529f\uff01"}
