Who was with you, and what did they think of the experience? What are some benefits of spending time outside?", "answer": "Last year, my friends and I went to the snow mountain for skiing. Frankly speaking, I had never skied before then, but I signed up for that without hesitation because I had always wanted to give it a try. There were 13 of us. When we finally set our foot on the snow mountain, we were amazed by the gorgeousness the nature presented to us. Before attending the skiing class, I was worried that if I could learn a new skill simply in a couple of hours. To everyone\u2019s surprise, despite the fact that it was literally my first attempt of skiing, I picked it up rather quickly, probably because I had learnt roller skating when I was about 10. After finishing the class, I was free to go on my own. I was then taught by my friends how to turn while keeping going, and again, I learnt quickly. After that, my friends and I went around and around on the harder track, and we all had great fun. If, for any reason, I had chosen otherwise, I suppose that I would regret so much once William came back from the snow mountain and showed me all the pictures and video clips he had shot when skiing. This is because I have actually experienced the great fun of skiing and viewed the amazingly gorgeous scenery of the snow mountain. Besides, I wouldn\u2019t have met so many amazing people who have taken good care of me and taught me how to ski. (252\u5b57)"}, "msg": "\u8bf7\u6c42\u6210\u529f\uff01"}
