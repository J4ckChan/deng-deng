Explain the reasons for your choice.", "answer": "I would like to be like Harry Potter from the book series of \"Harry Potter \"written by J.K. Rowling. The reason that I make this choice is that being able to use magic is a fascinating idea to me, and being capable of standing up for people is what I have always been aiming at. For example, If someone is bullied, then I will correct what is wrong by using the magic to appropriately punish the protagonist rather than expecting the imperfect law system to do justice. In conclusion, although it is impossible for me to be like Harry Potter, my ambition will never change and in order to stand up for people, I will continue to pursue bringing insights and reform into our law system.\uff08126 \u5b57\uff09"}, "msg": "\u8bf7\u6c42\u6210\u529f\uff01"}
