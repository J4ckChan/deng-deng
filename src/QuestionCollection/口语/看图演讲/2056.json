On the right side of the picture, there is a white plastic board that has different shapes on it, including a circle, square, and arrow, which may have been cut out by the woman. Also, there are several paper bags on the table that may be full of these plastic materials. In the background of the picture, there is a blue wall that has some painted flowers and leaves on it. In addition, there is a machine next to a workbench and there are some rolls of papers and other materials next to the machine, from which we can assume that it is a mechanic or engineering lab and the woman could be a mechanic, scientist, or engineer, and this plastic material probably can be used for 3D printing technology. In conclusion, this picture is really interesting and helps me to get a better understanding of mechanic design.
