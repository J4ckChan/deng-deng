Although some people believe that online classes are not as effective as in-person classes, I am more inclined to believe that online classes are equivalent to in-person classes. This is because online classes can be given through clear presentation of the slides and the teacher through share screen and video function. Students can be divided into groups to engage in discussion just like in an in-person class. With functions such as vote, the teacher can gather information from the students more easily. Therefore, there are many benefits that online teaching has so it is equivalent to in-person classes."}, "msg": "\u8bf7\u6c42\u6210\u529f\uff01"}
