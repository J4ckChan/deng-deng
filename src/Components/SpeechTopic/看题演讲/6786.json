This thing is that once I met my current best friend in a coffee shop. The first meeting in the coffee shop made us both feel good and curious about each other. We all really enjoyed the relaxed atmosphere here. We discussed each other's hobbies and future study and career plans. Luckily found out that we have the same hobbies and we live close together. Since then, we have spent more and more time together and got to know each other better. Eventually we became best friends. It was a very memorable experience for me. Before this, I always thought it was difficult to make friends, but this experience taught me that like-minded friends need to be actively sought out. \uff08131\uff09", "options": [{"content": "What was the event?"}, {"content": "When did it occur?"}, {"content": "Why is it a happy and memorable event for you?"}], "difficulty": 1, "difficultyName": "\u7b80\u5355\uff08100\u4ee5\u4e0b\uff09"}, "msg": "\u8bf7\u6c42\u6210\u529f\uff01"}
