The dog has white fur around the body and slightly yellow fur on the head. It jumps from the ground into the air to catch the yellow football. It looks so happy in a park where there are lush trees and a clear sky. I imagine the owner must be very happy too. I hope one day I could have a dog and bring it to a park to play like this.", "photo": "https://cdn.51ddedu.com/images/629522852747419648.jpg", "difficulty": 1, "difficultyName": "\u7b80\u5355\uff08100\u4ee5\u4e0b\uff09"}, "msg": "\u8bf7\u6c42\u6210\u529f\uff01"}
