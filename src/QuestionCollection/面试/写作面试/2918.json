How can people protect themselves from becoming addicted to social media? How would their lives be improved if they reduced screen time?", "answer": "Although the majority of people's use of social media is non-problematic, there is a small percentage of users that become addicted to social networking sites and engage in excessive or compulsive use. Social media addiction is harmful to our physical health as well as mental health. As a precaution, that person should engage in a digital detox, a period of time during which someone significantly reduces the time spent or abstains from using electronic devices such as smartphones or computers. This can include simple steps, such as turning off sound notifications and only checking social media sites once an hour. Other changes can include having periods in the day where there is self-imposed non-screen time, such as during meal times, or leaving the phone in a separate room at night so as not to disturb sleep. In this way, people tend to spend more time with family or friends and can focus on their studies or work, thus having a more successful life.
