The main reason is due to the development of technology. Compared to 100 years, nowadays, we can use electronics, such as washing machines and robot cleaners, to do house works, which helps us get the job done in a more effective and efficient way. However, this would not be possible without cutting-edge technology and some great inventions. As a result, we would have more time to engage in activities that we enjoy. For example, in some households, women are in charge of the housework, instead of men, and can use washing machines to clean up dishes and save themselves time to do other enjoyable activities. It could mean that many of these housewives could have an opportunity to step down the role of being a house cleaner and, instead, the role could be fulfilled by machines. As a result, many of these women can have more free time. Some of them choose to use their free time to get a part-time job and help support the family financially. Therefore, their role in the home will get changed as well.", "difficulty": 3, "difficultyName": "\u96be\uff08120\u4ee5\u4e0a\uff09"}, "msg": "\u8bf7\u6c42\u6210\u529f\uff01"}
