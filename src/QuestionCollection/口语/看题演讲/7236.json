There are many types of clothing in my country, among which clothing made of silk is the most representative. Silk is a kind of textile, which is woven from silk or synthetic fiber, man-made fiber, staple silk, etc. Besides, silk is a special product of China. The ancient working people of China invented and produced silk products on a large scale, which opened the first large-scale trade exchange between the East and the West in world history, known as the \"Silk Road\".
