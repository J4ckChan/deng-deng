It was a huge office with more than 300 employees and was on the entire 3rd floor of the Lotus building. This company is the largest call center in our city and has employed many professionals and students. This company mainly relied on outsourcing and call center jobs. The agents in this office were mostly young people who either called the end-users for selling products or services or received calls to give certain information to customers or to record their complaints about a particular product or service. The office used to work for large multinational companies to provide customer care service or to promote their products or services. In return, they would earn the commissions or a contracted amount. They also had a software development and web designing team who used to work for the direct clients. I went to meet my friend Ronald who was in the office at that time. He asked me to lend him some storybooks and was supposed to meet me near my home. But in the evening he called me to meet him in his office so that I could give him the books as well as talk to his manager regarding a part-time job I was looking for. \uff08229\u5b57\uff09", "options": [{"content": "What type of work did they do there?"}, {"content": "What did the space look like?"}, {"content": "Why did you visit it?"}], "difficulty": 3, "difficultyName": "\u96be\uff08120\u4ee5\u4e0a\uff09"}, "msg": "\u8bf7\u6c42\u6210\u529f\uff01"}
