She is very capable in sports and academic work and achieved incredible results in many areas. The reason I admire her is that she is always so energetic, encouraging, and with an optimistic attitude. She appealed to the public to focus on the diversity of beauty, to be tolerant, and be harmonious. She used her own behavior in the Olympics to show the world that competition does not mean competing with others, but means a self-challenging, self-developing, and positive attitude to failure. Her braveness and attitude towards failure have encouraged thousands of youth to participate in winter sports and help promote the egalitarianism of society.", "options": [{"content": "Who are they?"}, {"content": "What role do they play in society?"}, {"content": "Why do you respect them so much?"}], "difficulty": 1, "difficultyName": "\u7b80\u5355\uff08100\u4ee5\u4e0b\uff09"}, "msg": "\u8bf7\u6c42\u6210\u529f\uff01"}
