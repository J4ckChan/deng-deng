Provide reasons for why you chose that animal.", "answer": "Keeping a unique pet will surely give its owner an exceptional experience, but there certainly will be various associated concerns which the owner has to deal with. Also, the owner will need to assume a huge responsibility. I am going to briefly introduce you to keeping a hedgehog as a pet. Despite their spines, hedgehogs are incredibly friendly, and they can become extremely affectionate with owners. Hedgehogs are rather cute, and they make perfect pets since they are calm and need low maintenance. But bear that in mind: they require lots of attention, especially when they are small. As long as you are gentle and show no harm to hedgehogs, they will not use their spines against you. Before you buy a hedgehog, make sure you check the legislation in your area. Hedgehogs are nocturnal, so if you are not a night owl, it is better to choose another unusual pet. (151\u5b57)"}, "msg": "\u8bf7\u6c42\u6210\u529f\uff01"}
