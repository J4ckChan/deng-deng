What is enjoyable about this activity? How could it be improved?", "answer": "When I was in school, there was one extra-curriculum that I enjoyed very much. It was attending the drama club on every Tuesday afternoon after class. I really enjoyed this activity because the leader of the group was very knowledgeable and was a decent person that I respected and admired. Every time when all group members gathered together, this leader always introduced new concepts and ideas, which challenged our thinking and helped us improve on ourselves. This leader also introduced an excellent musical play, named Hedwig and the Angry Inch. It fleshed up my mind and challenged me to think from different perspectives. \nMoreover, some books that she mentioned back then are still my old time favourite! For example, Demian, the story of Emil Sinclair's youth, written by Hermann Hesse is such a wonderful book. When I read the book, I felt much related as I did share the same struggles and thoughts. \nThis drama club enabled me to meet people like that leader and many others who shared the same habits. It helped me make a lot of friends back then and broadened my social circle. "}, "msg": "\u8bf7\u6c42\u6210\u529f\uff01"}
