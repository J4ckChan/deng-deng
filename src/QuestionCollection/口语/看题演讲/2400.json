Sometimes, just thinking about the things you should do to feel better, like exercising or spending time with friends, can seem exhausting or impossible to put into action. In order to overcome depression, you have to do things that relax and energize you. This includes following a healthy lifestyle, learning how to manage stress better, setting limits on what you're able to do, and scheduling fun activities into your day. Getting support from others plays an essential role in overcoming depression. On your own, it can be challenging to maintain a healthy perspective and sustain the effort required to beat depression. At the same time, the very nature of depression makes it difficult to reach out for help. When you're depressed, the tendency is to withdraw and isolate so that connecting to even close family members and friends can be tough. \uff08162 \u5b57\uff09", "options": [{"content": "What activities might help someone overcome depression?"}, {"content": "What advice would you give to someone who feels depressed?"}, {"content": "Why might it be difficult to overcome depression?"}], "difficulty": 1, "difficultyName": "\u7b80\u5355\uff08100\u4ee5\u4e0b\uff09"}, "msg": "\u8bf7\u6c42\u6210\u529f\uff01"}
