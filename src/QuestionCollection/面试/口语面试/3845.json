Explain the reasons for your choice.", "answer": "To be happy we need to have enough money to cover our basic needs. Worrying about having enough money to put food on the table, or being able to pay medical bills in case a family member falls ill, is highly stressful, and can negatively affect happiness levels. But the bottom line is that money can't buy it all. In fact, there are many things which are vital to our happiness and well-being that simply can't be bought. Money can buy lust, attraction, power and so forth, but it can't buy love. This is because love is something intimate; something heartfelt; something mysterious. Money is none of these things. Money is simply a method of exchange \u2013 no more and no less. It's used to pay for a product or a service; its convenience, comfort, and luxury. One funny thing about love is that having too much money may even pose a difficulty in getting true love. For example, Everyone wants to associate with a wealthy person, due to this, it would be complicated to find true love since you may not be able to differentiate between the people who love you for who you are and those who love for what you have. Also, having money may help you in making good memories with your loved ones, but in the absence of love, all the money in the world cannot build a stable relationship. Thus, money can't buy love.
