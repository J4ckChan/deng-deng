What made the story funny? Who did you share the story with, and how did they respond?", "answer": "\"The Emperor's New Clothes\" is a short tale written by a Danish author. Two weavers promise an emperor a new suit of clothes that they say is invisible to those who are unfit for their positions, stupid, or incompetent \u2013 while in reality, they make no clothes at all, making everyone believe the clothes are invisible to them. When the emperor parades before his subjects in his new \"clothes,\" no one dares to say that they do not see any suit of clothes on him for fear that they will be seen as stupid. Finally, a child cries out, \"But he isn't wearing anything at all!\" The story is funny because the emperor is foolish enough to believe in the invisibility of the clothes with not even a tiny suspicion, and he dares to parade in front of all the citizens. When I told the story to my classmates, some laughed out loud while others pondered the implication of the story. As an idiom, the use of the story's title refers to something widely accepted as true or professed as being praiseworthy, due to an unwillingness of the general population to criticize it or be seen as going against popular opinion. The phrase \"emperor's new clothes\" has become an idiom about logical fallacies and is often used as irony on fool.\uff08221 \u5b57\uff09"}, "msg": "\u8bf7\u6c42\u6210\u529f\uff01"}
