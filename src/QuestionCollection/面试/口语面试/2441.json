Why do you enjoy it? What is one thing that could be improved in your neighborhood, and how would it benefit the residents?", "answer": "Pride in ownership is obvious when the residents, whether renters or owners, maintain their homes and care about their neighborhood. In my opinion, neighbours should participate to connect and create local groups that bring the residents together for the betterment of the area. Luckily, I've got a neighbour who is very kind to others. When I want an expensive tool for one-time use, my neighbour would be more than happy to lend it to me. When I am in the middle of cooking brunch, but one egg or spoonful of salt short, I know I can ask my neighbour for it, which would save me from driving all the way to the shopping centre. Of course, I will have to return the favour, but it won't necessarily be in the same means. For instance, when I finished cooking brunch, I would ask him to join me, and we would have a good gossip. That is how me maintain a healthy relationship in the locale. When it comes to what can be improved in my neighbourhood, I suppose that would be the security. Low crime rates give a neighborhood a sense of ease and calm. As safety and security are everyone's concern, crime is a quick way to tell if a neighborhood is improving or not. You can usually spot a transitional and improving neighborhood by the improvement or decline in its crime rates. Improving the security level of the locale will make the place more liveable and more agreeable for everyone in the neighbourhood. \uff08254 \u5b57\uff09"}, "msg": "\u8bf7\u6c42\u6210\u529f\uff01"}
