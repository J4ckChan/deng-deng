What would your parents think about your purchase? How would your purchase improve your life?", "answer": "Buying a house has long been a staple of the Chinese dream - go to college, get a job, get married, buy a house, and have some kids. Home buying is just one of the things I have to check off the list in order to be considered a grown-up. So, homeownership is my priority if I won one million dollars. Another major reason supporting my purchase is that investing in property is a proven path to long-term wealth. This means that I would have to choose a property that is highly likely to increase in value. My parents would probably be in favour of my purchase as one of the biggest wishes of typical Chinese parents is their children's settlement in capital cities, and a good settlement involves the ownership of a decent house. The past decade has seen the soaring of housing price in China's capital cities, and it is highly unlikely that the price would drop in another couple of decades. Therefore, having a house in major cities would give me long-term financial benefits. I will either have a place to live in or have a considerable amount of extra income by renting the house out.
