Explain your reasoning.", "answer": "When it comes to the trade-off between freedoms and safety, people's opinions vary from one another. Some people put freedom above everything and would rather die in pursuit of freedom while others value safety more over freedom. As far as I am concerned, it is absolutely fine to ask people to give up some freedoms in the interest of safety. Freedom is being able to think, say, and do whatever you want \u2013 to live your life as you please. Safety is being protected from harm \u2013 to live your life without fear of danger. It is an undeniable fact that though people may uphold freedom as an ultimate virtue, it's limited in a society. You can't have absolute freedom because it takes away from the safety and the freedom of others. If anyone could do whatever they wanted, and they chose to hurt and kill others, then it restricts someone else's freedom to live as they please. Therefore, in order to enjoy freedom, security should be the basic premise. We love to drive, and we love the freedom of driving. But there are limits to that freedom \u2013 limits that we all generally accept. There are limits to where you can drive, what directions you can drive, how fast you can drive, when you can drive, what you can drive, and a complex set of rules governing how you drive. All these traffic laws are designed to maximize safety while driving, but significantly hamper the freedom of driving. Yet we accept them because for all of us to have the relative freedom to drive, that freedom needs to be limited for everyone. Traffic laws help reduce deaths from collisions."}, "msg": "\u8bf7\u6c42\u6210\u529f\uff01"}
