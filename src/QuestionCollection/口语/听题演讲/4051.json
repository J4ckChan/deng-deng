It is an indisputable fact that parents play a significant role in the development of their children's behavior. Parental influences include problematic family functioning, such as low levels of parental monitoring and inconsistent disciplinary practices, as well as childhood maltreatment. It is commonly acknowledged that specific environmental factors may be particularly influential during critical developmental periods. Apart from that, parental mental disorders may act as barriers impeding their children's access to adequate mental health treatment, which in turn may increase the children's likelihood of developing antisocial behavior in adolescence.
