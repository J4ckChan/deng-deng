Why do you think people do this anyway?", "answer": "Some people often complain about things or keep whining. This is a waste of time because it does no good to anyone and does not solve the problem. People complain or whine mainly because they are emotional and have a bad mood due to certain unsatisfying things happening. They either release their bad emotion through complaining or avoid solving the problem by blaming others. Either way, complaining is a waste of time. Sometimes I also complain, mostly about myself doing not right, but I never waste too much time on it as I know I should find a practical solution to keep on moving. For example, I often release my emotion by taking a run for five minutes and then go back to work. This way, I can get back to working on solutions without a bad mood as quickly as possible.
