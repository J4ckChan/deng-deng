Do you agree or disagree? Provide support from your personal experience and/or observation to support your opinion.", "answer": "I agree. With a higher tax charged on unhealthy food, the price of unhealthy food would lift. So, comparatively, the price of healthy food is relatively low. This tax would effectively encourage people's consumption of healthy food instead of unhealthy food. For example, charging a high sugar tax would make a chain effect on the price increase of all products containing sugar. So people would always choose the products with less sugar for a cheaper price. Hence, an aggregated lower sugar intake."}, "msg": "\u8bf7\u6c42\u6210\u529f\uff01"}
