Near the water cooler at work, at kids' birthday parties (or adult birthday parties), or even while vacationing. Any time people want to avoid washing dishes, paper cups will become the go-to choice. First of all, paper cups are microwave safe. They are environmentally friendly and come at a reasonable cost. Most paper cups and other accessories are made of natural substances, meaning that they are recyclable, and therefore are a great way to reduce your carbon footprints. Even if the cups are made from recycled materials, they generally can't be recycled after this; both paper and plastic cups are difficult to recycle. Paper cups are plastic lined, so they don't soak in the liquid you put in them. That means that very few recycling facilities can handle this type of recycling process, which requires separating or breaking down the paper and plastic. \uff08155 \u5b57\uff09", "referenceText": "Discuss the benefits and drawbacks of disposable consumer goods, like razors and paper cups.", "referenceTranslate": "\u8ba8\u8bba\u4e00\u6b21\u6027\u6d88\u8d39\u54c1\u7684\u4f18\u7f3a\u70b9\uff0c\u6bd4\u5982\u5243\u987b\u5200\u548c\u7eb8\u676f\u3002", "difficulty": 2, "difficultyName": "\u4e00\u822c\uff08105~115\uff09"}, "msg": "\u8bf7\u6c42\u6210\u529f\uff01"}
