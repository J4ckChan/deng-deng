How do you thank them for these things? What is something important that you have learned from a parent?", "answer": "I was pretty much blessed in every way to have the most supportive, loving, understanding parents. In China, parents usually make it an unwritten rule that their kids get involved in one activity or job whether the kids want to or not. But my parents encouraged me to follow my own dreams and supported me 200% of the way. When I was only seven, I was already super interested in music, but my family wasn't that wealthy. My mom enrolled me in piano lessons and eventually found an affordable piano to have at home. My parents went to every single music event and supported me. This inspired me to follow my dreams. Their hard work resulted not only in a comfortable home, solid healthy meals on the table day in day out, clothes, cars, extracurricular expenses, etc. I thank them by learning really hard, and eventually got excellent grades in every subject learnt at school. The most important thing I have learnt from my parents is the value of hard work to follow my dreams and strive to make the most of opportunities available. I feel privileged to have the most amazing, wonderful parents! (194\u5b57)"}, "msg": "\u8bf7\u6c42\u6210\u529f\uff01"}
