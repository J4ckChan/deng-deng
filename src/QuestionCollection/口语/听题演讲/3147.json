I prefer to spend my leisure time outdoors. To begin with, spending time outdoors allows me to play all kinds of sports, which helps me become healthier. And playing sports requires me to concentrate, which can benefit my working performance. In addition, outdoor activities allow me to enjoy the beauties of nature. Walking or jogging in a park allows me to breathe fresh air and appreciate the scenery, which is quite pleasing. After all, people nowadays are spending too much in the concrete jungle.
