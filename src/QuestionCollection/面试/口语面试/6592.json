What are some measures that people take to minimize their impact? Which measures do you think work best?", "answer": "There are some measures that people can take to minimize their impact on the environment and I think the best measure is that when you go shopping, buy fruit and vegetables that are in season to help reduce enormous transport costs resulting from importing products and, where possible, choose locally produced food. Moreover, other measures include when buying fish, looking out for a variety of non-endangered species and buying local fish if possible. In addition, bring your own bags to the grocery and refuse the plastic bags that create so much waste, and look for products that have less packaging."}, "msg": "\u8bf7\u6c42\u6210\u529f\uff01"}
