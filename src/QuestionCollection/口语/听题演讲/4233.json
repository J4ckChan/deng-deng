It is the state capital of New South Wales of Australia. This city is situated on the bank of the Tasman Sea and has around 4.6 million people. I have been living in this city since 2013, and I enjoy my stay here. Sydney boasts a large number of national parks, botanic gardens, and beaches which attract millions of visitors annually. I can always find a new hiking route to enjoy my holidays. Besides, the Harbour Bridge and the Opera House are two of the most recognized landmarks in Australia. People are welcoming and friendly here. And the weather is generally pleasant all year round with plenty of sunshine. All these factors combined make it one of the most liveable cities across the globe. (137\u5b57)", "referenceText": "Describe your favorite city. Where is it?
