Today, I'm going to talk about a place that is unspoiled. Hawaii Volcanoes National Park on the \"Big Island\" of Hawaii is not only unspoiled, but it's also one of those few places where you can still see one of the primordial forces of nature at work. Two of the \"world's most active and accessible volcanoes\" are in this park. In addition, the fact that it is a national park also means that there's infrastructure for taking in the views, including an observation deck at the Jaggar Museum where you can watch the lava lake activity. People can protect unspoiled places by passing laws that only allow the minimum level of development in order to accommodate visitors, and employing specialized people to preserve the places.
