Why or why not? Give specific reasons for your answer.\"", "answer": "When it comes to whether certain types of films should be banned by the government, people's notions vary from one to another. As far as I am concerned, the government should prohibit certain types of films. To begin with, it is commonly acknowledged that films involving violence and sex may have a negative impact on the audience below the age of eighteen. This is because children of those ages are generally not mature enough to comprehend such information. Additionally, it should be pointed out that people might be imitating what they see in movies, and therefore violent and sexual content may not be of positive use. To put it in a nutshell, considering all the factors above, we can safely draw the conclusion that governments should ban certain types of films.
