As we can see from the picture, he wears a pair of gloves for helping him to fix a tyre on the train. Besides, it also should be pointed out that this train is printed in various kinds of colors, which can be illustrated in blue, gold, and orange. In my point of view, this train is indeed beautiful and fashionable so I guess that the train itself must be expensive. Moreover, I can also see that the train is roped and fixed so this repairman can easily repair the tyre. Last but not least, based on my own experience, this situation is more likely to happen in a factory which is built for repairing trains.
