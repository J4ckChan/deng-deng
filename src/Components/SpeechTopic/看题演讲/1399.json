It is the government's responsibility to help disabled people to have a more comfortable life. There are many things that cities can do to support them. For example, put ramps on public transportation and make assisted-use toilets more available. Governments should also encourage social inclusion and help the public to show more respect for people with disabilities. In the city where I am living, the government did a lot to help them. The most effective one is to provide special financial support and job opportunities for disabled people. As a result, disabled people are more likely to have a stable job and live a more comfortable life. \uff08116 \u5b57\uff09", "options": [{"content": "What kinds of things can they do?"}, {"content": "What does your city do to assist disabled people?"}], "difficulty": 2, "difficultyName": "\u4e00\u822c\uff08105~115\uff09"}, "msg": "\u8bf7\u6c42\u6210\u529f\uff01"}
