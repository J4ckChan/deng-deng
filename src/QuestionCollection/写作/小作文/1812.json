What are your guidelines for polite cell phone usage? Include specific examples.\"", "answer": "Nowadays, thanks to the advancement of technology, people can use their cell phones to have a conversation wherever they can, so issues such as speaking out loud in a crowded bus are of crucial concern and could represent rudeness. I always look around and make sure that no one could be disturbed by my volume before I make a phone call. For example, I will check people around me when I am in a subway, and if it is possible to affect someone reading or napping, I will use text messages rather than talk on the phone. In conclusion, it is essential to consider others' feelings before acting on anything that could have an impact on other people. \uff08119 \u5b57\uff09", "difficulty": 2, "difficultyName": "\u4e00\u822c\uff08105~115\uff09"}, "msg": "\u8bf7\u6c42\u6210\u529f\uff01"}
