Chinese New Year, also known as Spring Festival or Chinese Lunar New Year, is the equivalent of Christmas in most western countries. It starts at the beginning of spring and marks the end of winter, and the specific date is determined by the lunar calendar. During that time, everyone would participate in the celebration as it is an indispensable part of traditional Chinese culture dating back thousands of years. Every street, building, and the house where Spring Festival is celebrated is decorated with red. Red is the main color for the festival, as red is believed to be an auspicious color. And people eat reunion dinner with family on New Year's Eve. As far as I am concerned, preserving traditions is of great importance, because it helps people remember the importance of family and cherish the time they have together.
