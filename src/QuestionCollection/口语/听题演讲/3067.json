However, looking at the wider picture, there are lots of different ways that will really go a long way to help us all become much savvier about our home environment and encourage a more sustainable way of life. Firstly, solar panels are an essential feature for any ecological home. They provide householders with completely clean electricity. They are a long-term investment, and although there will be an initial layout of money, in the long term you could potentially save more money than you spend. Secondly, one of the most important things that people need to do is to invest in the right lightbulbs. Not only do energy-efficient bulbs use less electricity, but they also last longer, which means you don't have to spend money replacing them.
