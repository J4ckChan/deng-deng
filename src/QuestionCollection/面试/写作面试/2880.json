It also makes an important contribution to economic progress, as healthy populations live longer, are more productive, and save more. What I do to keep healthy is eating healthy food. Healthy eating has many other benefits. When we eat well, we sleep better, have more energy and better concentration \u2013 and this all adds up to healthier, happier lives! Healthy eating should be an enjoyable social experience. When children and young people eat and drink well, they get all the essential nutrients they need for proper growth and development and develop a good relationship with food and other social skills. Getting regular sleep and exercise are other important ways that most people will do to stay healthy. Having late nights can leave you feeling tired the next day. It can be difficult, but try to have at least 8 hours of sleep each night. \uff08152 \u5b57\uff09"}, "msg": "\u8bf7\u6c42\u6210\u529f\uff01"}
