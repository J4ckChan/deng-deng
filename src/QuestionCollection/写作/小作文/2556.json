Describe ways that people connect with each other by eating together.\"", "answer": "Food has been the central part of human culture for centuries. Although taste varies from person to person, people tend to gather together for eating. In my culture, business people tend to discuss business issues over a decent meal. Apparently, the likelihood of getting an agreement settled during dinner time is comparatively higher. The reason may be that when eating, people are more likely to be amused and get a sense of satisfaction, so all the parties can finally arrive at an agreement. Apart from that, when friends are to hang out together, a highly rated restaurant often comes as the top choice. People will have a good gossip while eating, and probably have a drink or two, then the conversation will go on for a fair while. \uff08128 \u5b57\uff09", "difficulty": 3, "difficultyName": "\u96be\uff08120\u4ee5\u4e0a\uff09"}, "msg": "\u8bf7\u6c42\u6210\u529f\uff01"}
