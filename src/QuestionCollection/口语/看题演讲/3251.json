Most of the salespeople we meet in our daily life are those who are standing behind the counter in the department stores. They ask for customers' needs, recommend the appropriate products to them, show them how to use them, and finally check out. To be a qualified salesperson, it is necessary to know the details and characteristics of the products they are going to sell. It is a difficult job also because a salesperson needs to catch customers' interest with only a few sentences and can lead them to purchase, therefore; mastering the needs of the targeted customer is essential. From my personal perspective, if there is any chance, I would like to try being a salesperson in the fashion field. It is an opportunity for me to practice my communication skills in the real business world.
