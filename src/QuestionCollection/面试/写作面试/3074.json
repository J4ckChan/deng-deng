What is it about this city or country that you think makes it a good place to study? What would you hope to accomplish while you are there?", "answer": "I would like to go to the United Kingdom to study. First and foremost, the education system implemented there is better than that in my home country due to the fact that the teaching is more practically oriented, and students are constantly encouraged to think creatively. In addition, there are a number of universities in the UK that are ranked, on average, much higher than those in my home country. This is because they have better teaching resources both in terms of teaching staff and hardware such as equipment and facilities. According to China Daily, 70% of the interviewees who agree with studying abroad at top-ranked universities, have demonstrated better performance at work. Apart from completing a master's degree, during the course of studying overseas, I look forward to accomplishing an internship in a related field in the UK. This will greatly benefit my future career. (146\u5b57)"}, "msg": "\u8bf7\u6c42\u6210\u529f\uff01"}
