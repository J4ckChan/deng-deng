Those fences are primarily used on construction sites to prevent pedestrians from walking into sites that involve potential dangers. I can tell that because those fences are painted in black and yellow to make them easily noticeable. However, those fences are not in use at the moment as they have been placed in order in the street. I suppose the little boy is having a tough life because he has no proper bed to sleep on, and is possibly homeless, given that it is daytime, but he is lying alone on top of the fences which are not supposed to accommodate people. He looks quite helpless. I feel deep empathy for him, and I really hope that his life can get better. \uff08142 \u5b57\uff09", "photo": "https://cdn.51ddedu.com/images/477110105683267584.jpg", "difficulty": 2, "difficultyName": "\u4e00\u822c\uff08105~115\uff09"}, "msg": "\u8bf7\u6c42\u6210\u529f\uff01"}
