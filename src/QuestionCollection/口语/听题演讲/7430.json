Beethoven and Mozart had different upbringings that I would argue played a key role in their development as composers. Mozart\u2019s Farther Leopold was a fine musician and composer with court influence and connection. Under his guidance, Mozart had already established themselves as child geniuses from an early age. Beethoven\u2019s early family life was quite brutal and there are accounts of his alcoholic Father being abusive. This colored the tone of Beethoven\u2019s music and maybe even gave him the drive to create such an array of stunning music. Like Mozart Beethoven was a brilliant piano performer with improvisational skills that dazzled his patrons and his audience. As such, Beethoven created a significant body of work for the piano just as Mozart had done before. At the heart of both composers\u2019 catalog of work for the piano are both Sonatas and Concertos. These have become the backbone of each composer\u2019s oeuvre offering aspiring pianists a window into the worlds of Mozart and Beethoven.
