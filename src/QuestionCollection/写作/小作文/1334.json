Describe one of these changes and why it has taken place. Include specific reasons.\"", "answer": "The last decade has seen significant shifts in the sources of fuel used to provide energy away from sources seen as \"dirtier\" for the environment and contributing to climate change like coal. The use of coal in China has declined since 2010 as natural and renewable energy become cheaper. According to a report released by the government, between 2010 and the first part of 2019, 546 coal-fired power plants had shut down. The reason for such a situation lies in people's awareness of environmental protection. People now tend to pay much more attention to the emission of gas and are committed to protecting the earth from the greenhouse effect.
