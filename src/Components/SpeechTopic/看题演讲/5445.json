I got the bunny from my best friend Aissa and it is a meaningful gift representing her wish when I first came to Australia. We were friends since a very young age and when I needed to go abroad, she was so concerned if I would get homesick so she bought the bunny and wrote a note with it, so whenever I get homesick, I can cuddle the bunny. Although I don't get homesick a lot, the bunny represents our friendship and I still treasure it a lot until now. I feel so attached to it and I feel like people are easy to get attached to things because they find a sense of belonging to certain objects. And I feel exactly the same with this toy bunny.", "options": [{"content": "What is the item?"}, {"content": "Why is it important to you?"}, {"content": "Why do people get attached to things?"}], "difficulty": 2, "difficultyName": "\u4e00\u822c\uff08105~115\uff09"}, "msg": "\u8bf7\u6c42\u6210\u529f\uff01"}
