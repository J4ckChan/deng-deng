The car has a lot of paint sprayed all over it, showing the sponsors behind the car racing team. A huge tailfin is mounted onto the tail of the car, supposedly to perform some kind of aerodynamic function \u2013 preventing the car from being lifted by strong air streams generated while the car runs extremely fast. I can tell, from the direction of its front left wheel, that the car is turning left. Since half of the car is off the grey asphalt track, I suppose that the driver probably somehow made a mistake. Beside the track, there is a lawn on which piles of white tyres are placed.
