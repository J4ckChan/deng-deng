The plant looks like a tree, but it grows sideways rather than upwards as an ordinary tree would do. It has a large number of brown trunks and countless green leaves. Some of its roots can be seen above the soil it is planted, and they are twisted. The parterre has a white flat edge and is placed on two wooden boards, which I suppose is for easy lifting by a forklift when it needs to be removed to another place. The greenhouse has curved, translucent roofs, and is supported by a number of white poles.
