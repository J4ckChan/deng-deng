Early childhood teachers help children to develop language and vocabulary skills as well as elementary numeracy, physical and social skills. To become an early childhood teacher, I will need to complete at least four years of tertiary study, including an accredited teacher education program, at a recognized university or higher education institution. The hardest thing about this job is that you have to be really patient to children because sometimes they can be annoying and keep bothering you. \uff0888 \u5b57\uff09", "referenceText": "Describe your dream job, what does it involve?
