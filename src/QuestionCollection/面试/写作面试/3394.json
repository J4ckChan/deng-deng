Who were you with, and how was the experience? What did you learn about yourself from eating this unusual food?", "answer": "Speaking of an unusual food I have ever eaten, it must be the baked snails. When I was travelling to France with my family for the first time, we were shocked when we saw there was a cuisine called baked snails on the menu. We have never eaten snails before and could not imagine how it would be tasted like. But the waiter highly recommended it saying it is a signature cuisine for their restaurant. Doubtfully, we ordered the baked snails. I have to admit that the taste surprised me as it is soft and mixed well with the red wine. Through this experience, I learnt that trying new things sometimes can give us unexpected surprises. (116\u5b57)"}, "msg": "\u8bf7\u6c42\u6210\u529f\uff01"}
