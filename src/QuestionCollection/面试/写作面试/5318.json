What makes you want to be good at this thing? How do you stay motivated, especially when you are tired or not sure about the outcome?", "answer": "I worked so hard on Math to be good at it. I am eager to be good at Math is because I think Math is fundamental to all Science, Technology, and Engineering related fields. However, learning Math truly requires logical thinking talent and a lot of practice, sometimes I try so hard but cannot make any processes. This would always result in exhaustion and depression. In that case, I would just read stories of Mathematicians such as Archimedes' stories or Euclid's stories to keep myself motivated."}, "msg": "\u8bf7\u6c42\u6210\u529f\uff01"}
