The place was surrounded by green mountains and forests. There was no ocean in that reserve, but the beautiful lake there was no less impressive and inviting than an ocean. The place looked so beautiful, and the natural smell of the luscious green there was so intoxicating that I felt like I could spend the rest of my life there. Besides, the calming effect of the beautiful lake on my mind and body felt like a supernatural experience to me.\uff08107 \u5b57\uff09", "referenceText": "Describe the most beautiful natural scenery you have ever seen.
