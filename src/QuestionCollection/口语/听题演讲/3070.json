Wildlife must have places to find food, shelter and raise their young. Parks, reserves, and other open spaces benefit wildlife by providing habitat, while also providing us with great places to visit and enjoy. Programs of those organizations have brought some of these species back from the brink through captive breeding and reintroduction programs. Also, you can always see people in uniform that represents their organizations. They are there to give pedestrians a brief on the crisis wildlife in the country are facing, and persuade people to donate, even if the donation is as small as several dollars per week, which is just the cost for a cup of coffee, still, it would make a difference in the long run. Apart from that, to minimize the number of wildlife killed on roads in my country, road signage is being used on most of the country roads. It reminds drivers to be conscious of animal behavior near roadsides.
