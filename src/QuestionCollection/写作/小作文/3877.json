Obesity is a disease that people develop when they become considerably overweight. And it can further lead to a series of serious consequences, such as the loss of mobility and a broad range of complications among which some can even kill the patients. Therefore, it is of great importance to warn people of the danger of obesity and inform them of ways to prevent it. Firstly, people should consume less unhealthy food, such as those high in sugar or fat. Secondly, it should be encouraged that people eat slowly and only when hungry as overeating is the major cause of obesity. Thirdly, people should incorporate fun and exciting physical activities and try to keep exercising on a regular basis.
