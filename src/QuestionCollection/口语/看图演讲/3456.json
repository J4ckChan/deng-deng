From this angle, we can see that four people are sitting beside each side and wearing heavy protection. Some of them are lifting their legs vertically to their body, indicating they are nervous at that time, while other players seem not nervous with their legs naturally down. Also, I can see clearly that one girl has already begun screaming. This picture reminds me of my first experience riding the roller coaster with my friends. I was frightened but also excited, and my friends were holding my hands firmly so that I can get the courage from them. After that experience, I realized that if we can muster the courage to attempt, we would complete the task that we thought impossible before.
