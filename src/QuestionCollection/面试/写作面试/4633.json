Explain your reasoning.", "answer": "When it comes to the approach of solving problems, people's notions vary from one another. I personally would prefer to solve problems on my own. The first and foremost reason why I tend not to discuss every problem with someone else is that when I ask people for a favour, I feel like I owe them, and this feeling wouldn't go away until I get the chance to return the favour. This is my principle of maintaining a healthy relationship with friends. Apart from that, trying to solve problems on one's own in the first place can greatly enhance his skills and hence his level of independence, which can be hugely beneficial to his future life. To put it in a nutshell, it is recommended that people try to solve problems on their own rather than discuss every problem with someone else. (142\u5b57)"}, "msg": "\u8bf7\u6c42\u6210\u529f\uff01"}
