The man is wearing a black shirt and a pair of black pants. He has black short hair. He is holding an umbrella on top of which there is a pink ball. I suppose it requires years of practice to steadily balance the ball on top of the inclined surface of an umbrella. Apparently, this is some kind of traditional Chinese acrobatics. Apart from that, in the background, I can see a large audience surrounding this man, watching the performance. It seems that they are enjoying the show. And from the looks of the adjacent buildings and the people, I can tell it is probably someplace in Japan.
