Do you agree or disagree with this statement? Use examples from personal experience and observations to support your perspective.", "answer": "When it comes to making changes that can have a social impact on many people, we usually believe that it requires a lot of people working together in a form of, for example, organization. However, I believe that even one person can help make such changes. This is because a positive social change that benefits people does not have to be big. Small changes such as following the traffic rules can influence others. By obeying the rules herself, one can raise awareness of the importance of doing so. To conclude, it is imperative that we believe in the power of each person and starts making positive changes by ourselves."}, "msg": "\u8bf7\u6c42\u6210\u529f\uff01"}
