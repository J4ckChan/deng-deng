Explain your reasoning.", "answer": "Surely there are things about people that they themselves don't like or are not liked by others, so they change them. Nonetheless, sometimes it's more likely that the people keep on doing them, even though they said they would like to change them. There is an old saying, \"A leopard can't change its spots.\" Well, it is virtually true in the animal world, but we people don't necessarily see the same pattern. To me, this is more of a philosophical or psychology issue, or probably bit of both, and it can get rather complicated. Hereby, I'll just express my personal thoughts. Firstly, \"personality\" is a word used to describe traits that are consistent across time and place. For example, we expect a highly extraverted person to be outgoing at home, at work, and at school. While personality is not a perfect predictor of behavior, it does give us a general idea of how someone is likely to think and act. In this sense, people are less likely to be able to change, instead, they can just act like they have changed in order to fit into the environment. On the other hand, when it comes to the way people behave and think, personally speaking, people are able to change. However, people can't just snap their fingers and say goodbye to well-established patterns, even when those patterns result in bad consequences, because those patterns have been shaped since we were young. People are so used to behaving and thinking in a particular way that the change will require extensive effort and will be quite time-consuming. We cannot expect to see the change take place any time soon. It is usually a slow process, and is highly dependent on one's commitment, and it takes perseverance.\uff08293 \u5b57\uff09"}, "msg": "\u8bf7\u6c42\u6210\u529f\uff01"}
