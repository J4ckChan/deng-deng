Who would you take with you? What activities would you want to do during the trip?", "answer": "When it comes to a perfect vacation trip that I am eager to go for, the first thing that springs to my mind is to ski on a snowy mountain. It was last winter, after I saw a video my friend Will shot while skiing, which left me a great impression, the desire for skiing had been implanted in my mind. It never occurred to me that skiing could be so much fun. And I was surprised to find that the scenery on a snowy mountain could be so gorgeous. I would take my friends with me. Except for skiing, which I would definitely do, I would also like to drink coffee and enjoy the magnificent scenery on the snowy mountain. At night, my friends and I would sit around a fireplace, drinking, chatting and playing games. How awesome it would be! I cannot wait for the trip to begin."}, "msg": "\u8bf7\u6c42\u6210\u529f\uff01"}
