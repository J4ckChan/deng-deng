Explain your reasoning.", "answer": "From my perspective, a requirement on following a dress code on the job is a good thing since a dress code allows an employer to set expectations regarding the image it wants the company to convey to partners, clients and public. To be more specific, a law firm with employees all wearing suits shows an image that they are professional and accountable in the field compared to those wearing T-shirts and shorts. Moreover, the standard for dress codes creates a standard for visual cohesion. This allows employees to feel part of a group and have a feeling of all working toward one purpose.
