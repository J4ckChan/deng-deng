Who would you teach this skill to and why? How do you think knowing this skill would improve their lives?", "answer": "Being proficient in English is a skill that I have and could teach to others. It is something a lot of people my age don't have. From a young age, I watched numerous English movies and listened to English songs, which gave me a firm grasp on the language. This also laid a concrete foundation for my English study. At the age of 16, I went abroad alone to Australia where I completed secondary and tertiary education. I would teach English to anyone who wants to study English as a second language for academic, business or other general reasons. I suppose they can use it either to further their study abroad, facilitate their work, or make their life easier in overseas countries. (122\u5b57)"}, "msg": "\u8bf7\u6c42\u6210\u529f\uff01"}
