It is not like Spanish and Italian or other European languages that are more similar to each other. Some may say English pronunciation is also very different from Chinese pronunciation, but I believe that listening and imitating how native English speakers say it can be helpful, and you don't have to sound exactly like a native speaker. Once my pronunciation does not hinder communication, I think I will be fine. As a result, learning grammar requires more attention to detail, especially when dealing with academic writing. For example, in Chinese, we put every adjective in front of a noun to describe it, while in English, adjectives can be a relative clause or other grammatical structures that can be put behind a noun. Therefore, it is very challenging when our first language interferes with the use of the second language. The most helpful resources would be a large amount of reading followed up by summarizing the reading and paraphrasing. Reading helps to make sure that I am exposed to all kinds of vocabulary and grammar regularly and gives me content knowledge, which I do not have to come up with when writing. This gives me a chance to focus more carefully on my language performance rather than struggling with what idea or content I am going to present. Later on, teachers may correct my mistakes or errors in my summary and paraphrasing, which could help me understand the grammar. I believe this is the best way for me to improve my grammar.
