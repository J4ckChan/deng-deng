Why don't many people know this about you? How do you think your friends would react if they knew this about you?", "answer": "It is not known by many people that I'm actually very good at cooking, and I even take a cooking lesson twice a week just to enhance my cooking skill. I think learning to cook is very interesting and it is an essential life skill that we should all possess. A good homecooked dish is the best way to be sure of what you are eating and will contribute to a healthy lifestyle. Not many people know this about me because I'm still not very good at it. I still have a long way to go and I'm not intended to announce it to my friends yet. I guess if I tell my friends that I know how to cook, I think they would be astonished, which is also my intention that I want to give them a big surprise.\uff08140\u5b57\uff09"}, "msg": "\u8bf7\u6c42\u6210\u529f\uff01"}
