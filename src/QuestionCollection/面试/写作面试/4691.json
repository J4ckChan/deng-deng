Explain the reasons you respect that person so much.", "answer": "When it comes to a person whom I respect a great deal, I suppose it would my father. To me, he is a hero, an ideal father, a benevolent person and a man of his honour. He is in his 50s now. We live in a family of 4, and he is the head of our family. Though he can't manage every aspect of our family due to his age, yet he is still the decision-maker for our family, and every single decision he has ever made involves a high level of sophistication and great kindness towards every other person. I remember him from my early childhood when he used to play chess with me. He taught me many things including the value of responsibility, honesty and punctuality. He told me some of his great adventures in his life through stories and those stories are still inspiring for me. He is a person of his word. He would not talk much but when he does it carries unparallel weights. He is a benevolent person as I have seen him helping many people in our locality. I want to become a person like him.
