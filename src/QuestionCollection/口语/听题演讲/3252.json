The routine on weekends is a feast with family or friends, where I can share my study and life with them. Their comfort and opinions become the source of my courage in facing challenges. After that, we normally stroll in the park or go hiking if it is a sunny day. Breathing the fresh air, I can definitely get rid of the hustle and bustle on weekdays. Otherwise, a new-launched movie would also be a great choice on rainy days. Weekends are also an appropriate time for me to find new interests, for instance, playing guitar and skateboards. These activities help me to pause worrying about my study and deadlines and restore my energy. If unfortunately, I need to study on weekends to finish my assignments, I would still take a break for half-day to refresh my mind.
