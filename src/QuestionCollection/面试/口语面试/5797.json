Use examples from your personal experience and observations to support your opinion.", "answer": "Now, a lot of people choose to keep an artificial plant as opposed to real plants. The reason for this weird trend is artificial plants are easy to keep. Even if people do not take care of it or water it, it would always look good. Everything the keeper needs to do is to wipe the dust on it. Now the simulation production is very outstanding, an artificial plant can look as real as the alive plants. Plus, in the fast-paced world, people would rather spend time on other things rather than keeping a plant."}, "msg": "\u8bf7\u6c42\u6210\u529f\uff01"}
