What did you learn from this situation? If you had the power to change it, what would you have done differently?", "answer": "This article is about the last time I heard about something that I thought was unfair. This thing was that my friend was discriminated against by other students because of his poor academic performance. Before this incident, I always believed that the quality of academic performance should not be used as a reason to discriminate against others. However, after my friend's experience, I was very disappointed with the performance of other students. I think it is too one-sided to evaluate a person's performance only from the perspective of academic achievements. An excellent person should have more good morality and a sense of responsibility. If I have the ability to change him, I will take him to study together and give him more academic help. \uff08123\uff09"}, "msg": "\u8bf7\u6c42\u6210\u529f\uff01"}
