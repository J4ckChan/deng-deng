Provide reasons to support your opinion.", "answer": "When it comes to something that is popular now and will disappear in the near future, the first thing that jumps into my mind is the USB disk. According to a report released by the United Nations, with the development of technology and the economy, 50 percent of the world's population will be using smartphones and computers. By 2025, mobile data networks will cover 90 percent of the population. With cloud services like Apple, Alicloud Dropbox, Google, and Microsoft offering near-unlimited storage at near-free prices, there will be little need for storage devices taking up room in your pocket. Not to mention the increase in standard storage for mobile devices in the next few years. Despite the fact that USB disks are quite popular nowadays due to their portability, they will soon disappear due to the fact that people don't need them anymore.
