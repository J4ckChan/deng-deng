My dad would always come and help me warm my bed an hour before I slept. We didn\u2019t want to waste this hour, so it has become the reading time for our family. My mom always sat in front of my desk, and read her own books, and my dad would tell stories to me while warming up my bed. After a story was told, the bed was warmed. This childhood memory brings me a cute feeling every time whenever I think of it. It always reminds me of the family reading time, and how my dad shared his views and perspectives with me. This story actually works as an interior trigger to grow my own curiosity even after I grew up.
