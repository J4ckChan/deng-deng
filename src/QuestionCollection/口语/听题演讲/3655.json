Du Fu lived through the violent fall of China's brilliant Tang dynasty. As rebel armies sacked the capital, and floods and famine wrecked the country, he was forced to flee, taking his family on the roads as refugees. But out of these events he produced what Harvard's literature professor calls 'the greatest poems in the Chinese language', words that ever since have been seen as an expression of what it means to be Chinese. Du Fu's poem has resonated through the centuries, describing the experiences of ordinary people caught up in war, corruption, famine, and natural disasters. In China, poets have always been seen as the trusted chroniclers of people's hearts and the nation's history, and for the Chinese, Du Fu is more than a poet. For generations, he has been the guardian of the moral conscience of the nation.
