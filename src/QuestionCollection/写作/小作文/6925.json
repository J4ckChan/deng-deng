Do you agree or disagree? Why? Give specific reasons for your answer.\"", "answer": "It is a proven theory that games play an inevitable role in children\u2019s physical and mental development. Many people argue that games are equally important for adult\u2019s life too. This essay agrees with the statement for various reasons. Games help the physical and mental development of every person. By actively participating in the game one can understand his weakness and he himself can master many new skills in his life. The person who engages himself in the \u2018word game\u2019 of the newspaper every day is an example. He can try to answer all the questions and for all the unknown answers he will dig himself in the books. So, like children, adults should actively participate in the games for their mental development.", "difficulty": 2, "difficultyName": "\u4e00\u822c\uff08105~115\uff09"}, "msg": "\u8bf7\u6c42\u6210\u529f\uff01"}
