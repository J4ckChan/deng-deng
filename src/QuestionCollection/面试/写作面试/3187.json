Provide reasons to support your opinion.", "answer": "Form a patient's perspective, I would argue that the most pressing medical problem is to improve the doctor-patient relationship, regardless of the number of resources it would take. That is to say, the medical industry should try its best to deal with patients' most basic complaints. Nowadays, hospitals and health care organizations are using too many gimmicks when it comes to improving patient satisfaction and enhancing the patient experience. These include things such as flashy surveys, customer service agents, and computer apps. Forget these. Why not just listen to your patients' most basic complaints? Two of these would be getting a good nights' sleep and tastier food! These are by far the two biggest complaints that I hear each and every day. Hospitals everywhere are failing to grasp the fact that what patients want is really quite simple. The list would also include more time with their doctors. It's not rocket science. Listen, learn and create the right hospital environment. (160\u5b57)"}, "msg": "\u8bf7\u6c42\u6210\u529f\uff01"}
