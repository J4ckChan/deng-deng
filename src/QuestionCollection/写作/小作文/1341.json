Do you agree or disagree with this philosophy? Why? Give specific reasons for your answer.\"", "answer": "Although some people believe that never giving up is the fundamental philosophy when aiming at success, I am more inclined to the belief that evaluating the possibility of achieving goals and managing time accordingly is a more efficient way to avoid any work that is in vain. If people keep trying and never stop working towards an almost impossible goal, then they will have wasted time and resources, which could have been utilized somewhere else. Therefore, the philosophy of never giving up is not necessarily applicable to everyone in our society, especially when someone cannot set a reachable goal. \uff08100 \u5b57\uff09", "difficulty": 3, "difficultyName": "\u96be\uff08120\u4ee5\u4e0a\uff09"}, "msg": "\u8bf7\u6c42\u6210\u529f\uff01"}
