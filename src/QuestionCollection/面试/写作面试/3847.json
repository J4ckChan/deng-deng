What is your favorite thing to do after school? What activity would you like to add to your routine and why?", "answer": "Usually, I am overwhelmed after a full schedule of classes, so I go to the convenience store opposite my school to get some refreshments. There I can also chat with my classmates for a while as the store always attracts numerous students with its large variety of snacks. After getting home, I first unpack my backpack, taking out all the assignments that I need to complete by the end of the day so that I can get a rough idea of how much time I will need to spend on them. If the weather allows, then I get changed and go outside to play some sports, either riding a bicycle or playing basketball. A bit of exercise is necessary for a healthy life. And I really enjoy the feeling of sweating. After that, I go home to take a shower. Then I turn on my computer either to play the trending music playlist or the TV series I like until dinner time. Having dinner with the family is always a pleasure as we get to share what we have experienced during the day with each other. After dinner, I go back to my room to do my assignments. If I can finish them early, I can still go to watch TV with my parents. Typically, 10 o'clock is my bedtime. In terms of the activity, I would like to add to my routine, I will probably choose to help my mum with chores around the house, for instance, doing dishwashing after dinner.
