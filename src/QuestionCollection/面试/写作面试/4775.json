How has it improved your time at school? How would your day be different if your school took this away?", "answer": "When it comes to a thing that my school has and I think all school should have for students, I would say it is the recess. The recess in my school that I would like to introduce to every other school is not the regular recess in between each two classes. It is a 20-minute short break scheduled at 11 o'clock, in middle of the 4 classes in the morning. During the recess, a snack will be dispensed to each student in front of the canteen. It can be a muffin, a small bottle of flavoured milk, a sausage roll, etc, varying throughout the week. The recess reduces the likelihood of students starving before their lunch at 1 o'clock. Also, it reduces stress levels and allows students to feel more relaxed. If the recess is taken away, I will probably be starving from 11 to 1 and have less chance to experience fresh air and sunshine which are both noted for increasing overall health and mood, and hence i will lose the ability to concentrate on class."}, "msg": "\u8bf7\u6c42\u6210\u529f\uff01"}
