I have had this goal for a year now because I realized that nowadays, knowing more than one language is an advantage not only in our daily lives but also in work environments. In order to achieve this, I registered for a Japanese class for beginners, twice a week. I also downloaded an application on my iPhone that not only includes an English test but also helps people study foreign languages named Duolingo so that I can study on my own at home. For the first two months, I did not skip any classes and spent at least 30 minutes every night studying Japanese on Duolingo at home. Unfortunately, I could not keep up with the schedule for long since I was working full time, not to mention that I had many other social activities that distracted me from studying. There were days when I was so busy that I had to work overtime to finish my job. As a result, I wasn't able to go to class and I definitely didn't have any time to study at home. Moreover, my friends complained that I had been ignoring them, so I needed to arrange a time to hang out with them. Just like that, I gradually lost my ambition to study Japanese and until now, I can only remember one alphabet table, even though Japanese uses three types of alphabets. \uff08246\u5b57\uff09", "referenceText": "Describe a goal or ambition you have not yet achieved.
