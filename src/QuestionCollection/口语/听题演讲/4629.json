Specifically, an unhappy child can take place where parents or other significant people such as teachers were extremely critical of the child or even mistreat the child. An abusive relationship can be mentally disruptive to a child's self-esteem, as well as cause a number of other mental illnesses such as anxiety disorder or depression. Typically, children with low self-esteem would be extremely critical of themselves, downplay or ignore their positive qualities, and hence judge themselves to be inferior to their peers. They also would use negative words to describe themselves such as stupid, fat, ugly, or unlovable. They would blame themselves when things go wrong instead of taking into account other things over which they have no control such as the actions of other people or economic forces. What's more, they may have difficulty with relationships and problems at school and at home. (194\u5b57)", "referenceText": "What can lead to the problem of a child having low self-esteem?
