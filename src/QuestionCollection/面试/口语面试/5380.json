Provide reasons to support your opinion.", "answer": "Now, because of the pandemic, more and more industries have moved online, including the education industry. I believe this is a good trend to get a good education. Learning online means students can save time on the way from home to school and from school to home. In addition, students are provided with a more flexible studying environment. Moreover, I think it is quite important to provide students with autonomy because as the education level goes higher, people would realize that self-learning and self-development are very crucial personal skills. So, they get to practice this crucial skill earlier and find their own learning style earlier."}, "msg": "\u8bf7\u6c42\u6210\u529f\uff01"}
