Who can you ask for advice on how to succeed in college? What would you expect to learn from him or her?", "answer": "The transition from higher school to college can be exciting as well as challenging for prospective students. As far as I am concerned, the most difficult thing about college is that students will be expected to maintain their own schedules and develop good study habits. Because there is no longer someone around to force the student to study, to go to class, or to get a good night sleep. Students have to create a structure that works for them. Time management is a necessary skill that must be learned or improved through university life. Fortunately, most universities have counselling service provided for students who have trouble coping with university life, and they can ask for advice free of charge. Additionally, the university I went to has programmes where a senior student is assigned to a new student who needs help to assist him or her with any sort of problems relating to college for a couple of weeks, which I believe would be extremely helpful. Students can expect to learn all kinds of skills that college students need in order to successfully complete their degree, including time management skill.
