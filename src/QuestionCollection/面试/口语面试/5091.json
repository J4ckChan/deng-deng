Explain your reasoning.", "answer": "Technology definitely made people's livelihood easier and more convenient. Now the internet allows us to receive information and give information quickly. From this side of the Earth, we can read news and events from some other corners of this world. Also, if we do not have time to buy groceries, we can shop online and book a delivery to our accommodations. Internet links our whole world together. Furthermore, from the hardware side, phones, laptops, pads, and e-books are designed light-weighted and small. They have all functions we need, for example, contacting through phone calls, games, social media, texts, surfing online, and they are easy to carry. With the development of technology, the interfaces were designed more interactive, and more approachable to user experiences. So technology really made life easier."}, "msg": "\u8bf7\u6c42\u6210\u529f\uff01"}
