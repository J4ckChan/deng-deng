How did their loyalty make you feel about the friendship? What can you learn from this experience?", "answer": "Loyalty is perhaps the most prized quality in any relationship. Those who can claim this virtue are often blessed with better health and overall relationship satisfaction and happiness. It comes at a time when my best friend William heard a rumor about me. He could have been passive and silent, and heard the rumor and not commented on it. Alternatively, he could have been a backstabber and continued to spread the rumor without even figuring out the truth beforehand. However, William defended me without a doubt and stopped that person who told the rumor and asked him not to spread it any further. The very moment I learned about the news, I was deeply moved. From his response, I could tell that he had a strong faith in me. No matter what others said about me, he would always stand by my side. Moreover, I learned that friends should always be loyal to each other. A loyal friend might not agree with you all the time, and they won\u2019t always have the same opinions as yours, but they still want you to know the truth. \uff08185 \u5b57\uff09"}, "msg": "\u8bf7\u6c42\u6210\u529f\uff01"}
