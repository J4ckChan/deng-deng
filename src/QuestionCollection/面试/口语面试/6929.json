Why are these important for group projects?", "answer": "To function successfully in a small group, students need to be able to communicate clearly on intellectual and emotional levels. Effective communicators can explain their own ideas, express their feelings in an open but non-threatening way, listen carefully to others, ask questions to clarify others\u2019 ideas and emotions, can sense how others feel based on their nonverbal communication, will initiate conversations about group climate or process if they sense tensions brewing, and reflect on the activities and interactions of their group and encourage other group members to do so as well. Regular open communication, in which group members share their thoughts, ideas, and feelings, is a must for successful group work. Unspoken assumptions and issues can be very destructive to productive group functioning. When students are willing to communicate openly with one another, a healthy climate will emerge and an effective process can be followed."}, "msg": "\u8bf7\u6c42\u6210\u529f\uff01"}
