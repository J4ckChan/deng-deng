Discuss some of the implications of this phenomenon.\"", "answer": "The controversial issue in respect of living longer has drawn huge public attention and sparked a heated debate in today's society. As far as I am concerned, there are both advantageous and disadvantageous implications brought by this phenomenon. To begin with, it is commonly acknowledged that people living longer marks the advancement of civilization. With a prolonged lifespan, people get to experience a lot more, even after retirement, than they could before. On the flip side of the coin, people living longer will eventually lead to a dramatic change in demographic structure, which can in turn pose a number of challenges to human society. For instance, a greater elderly population means a greater financial burden for the government as elder people generally use more services in the welfare system.", "difficulty": 3, "difficultyName": "\u96be\uff08120\u4ee5\u4e0a\uff09"}, "msg": "\u8bf7\u6c42\u6210\u529f\uff01"}
