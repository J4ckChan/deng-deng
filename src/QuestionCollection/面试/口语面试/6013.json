Mulan took her aged father's place in the conscription for the army by disguising herself as a man. After prolonged and distinguished military service against nomadic hordes beyond the northern frontier, Mulan is honored by the emperor but declines a position of high office. She retires to her hometown, where she is reunited with her family and reveals her gender, much to the astonishment of her comrades. Her braveness really inspired me and I want to talk to her about her perspective as a woman."}, "msg": "\u8bf7\u6c42\u6210\u529f\uff01"}
