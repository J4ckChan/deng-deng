Provide reasons to support your opinion.", "answer": "There is no greater feeling than having your bags packed and knowing you\u2019re ready to go on your next adventure. There are few things in life that will impact you as much as traveling will. Something happens to us when we board a plane in one country and land in another\u2014it\u2019s almost as if our eyes open again for the first time. The excitement and life experiences that happen when you travel are unlike anything else. These moments are transformative; they take us out of our element and remind us of why we are here. Nothing changes the way you view your own life experience like seeing the way other people live. Not only will you be more appreciative and thankful for the life you have, you\u2019ll also have a new sense of wonder and empathy for other cultures and countries. Soak in the language, the lifestyle and what people in foreign countries value\u2014you\u2019ll realize it\u2019s different everywhere in the world and it will undoubtedly make you evaluate your own values. Once you\u2019re hooked on traveling and understand its true power, you know that looking up at the Eiffel Tower or seeing the beaches in Thailand out-values any merchandise you could ever possibly purchase. Instead of buying a luxurious car, you invest in what\u2019s more important to you\u2014seeing places you haven\u2019t been to yet and immersing yourself in new cultures. Travel doesn\u2019t become something you do\u2014it\u2019s a way of life. No country or even city lives the same way. Countries have different cultures, and people have different beliefs, but when you travel, you see that no matter how different people are or the way they live, there is inherent goodness in most people. It\u2019s the common thread that ties us all together.\uff08322 \u5b57\uff09"}, "msg": "\u8bf7\u6c42\u6210\u529f\uff01"}
