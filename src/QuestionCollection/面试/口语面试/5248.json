How did their loyalty make you feel about the friendship? What can you learn from this experience?", "answer": "All of my friends are loyal to me. If I need to describe a time when a friend was loyal to me, I would say that it was when I was experiencing a financial crisis. I had no money to pay for the rent and pay for food because I was out of the job for 3 months. After my friend heard about what was going, she kindly offered her help. She paid for the rent and the food so that I could get covered for at least 2 months. She also promised me that before I got back on my feet, she would continue to support me financially and she would always support me spiritually. It was a very nice thing for her to do. My friend\u2019s loyalty made me feel secure. I was glad that I had such a good friend. Also, there were things that I learned from the experience. First, having a good friend is nice and friends can be helpful during tough periods. Secondly, I reward back my friends when they need help. But in order to do that, I need to get a job first and start to become independent. "}, "msg": "\u8bf7\u6c42\u6210\u529f\uff01"}
