Do you agree or disagree? Why? Give specific reasons for your answer.\"", "answer": "In today's world, the use of technology is ever increasing. I totally agree that contemporary technology is gradually creating a single world culture. The most important reason is the widespread of the Internet, through which people can communicate easily with others who are far away and exchange ideas with each other, which makes them influenced by the same culture regardless of their nationality.
