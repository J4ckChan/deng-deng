What other types of technology that we don\u2019t have yet could be potentially be useful to you?", "answer": "Technology plays a great role nowadays. It eases us in all aspects. Without smartphones, computers, cars, washing machines, and so on. It would be a very different world as we all know it today. The fact is all of us rely on technology daily.

Everybody has a smartphone, so we can communicate easily. I can hardly imagine a time without television and the internet. I dream of a robot that can replace the work of a fridge, dishwasher, and washing machine, it all helps us finish all the chores at home. Technology affects my life in so many ways that it is extremely hard to imagine how much convenience it brings to us. (144 words)"}, "msg": "\u8bf7\u6c42\u6210\u529f\uff01"}
