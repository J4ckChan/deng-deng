Until last weekend, we have already made an exclusive relationship for one year and he told me that we needed to celebrate this anniversary. I thought that it was a good idea and probably we could have a party together. After discussing it for two hours, we decided to have a party in a five-star restaurant which was located in the city centre. Besides, he also bought one big cake and a necklace for me. Thus, I also prepared a pair of sneakers for him. On that day, we went to that luxury restaurant together and had dinner; then, we exchanged gifts and eat that tasty cake. This was an anniversary celebration, which happened last weekend.
