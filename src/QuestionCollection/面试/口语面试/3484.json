Explain your reasoning.", "answer": "From my perspective, the most important thing humans can do for the environment is to reduce the carbon footprint from individual aspects. The increasing carbon dioxide has caused a series of problems, like rising temperature and poisonous smog, which have caused severe problems in our daily life. Actually, there are lots of behaviors we can change to reduce carbon dioxide emissions. To be more specific, we can reduce the usage of unrecycled plastic in our daily life, such as plastic bags and plastic cookware. Moreover, rather than driving private cars, choosing public transportations can reduce the emission of exhaust fumes, in turn, we will have clean air to breath. Through our efforts, the carbon footprint caused by burning waste can be reduced significantly, which can contribute to a better environment. Efforts can also be made by what and how much we eat. Eating a vegetarian or are also likely to be better for the environment than a diet which includes a lot of meat. (164\u5b57)"}, "msg": "\u8bf7\u6c42\u6210\u529f\uff01"}
