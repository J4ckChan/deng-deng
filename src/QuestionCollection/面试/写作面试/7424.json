What type of education style do you prefer for yourself, and why?", "answer": "I think schools should allow students to choose the subjects they want to study. Students' favorite school subjects may have some influence on their future career path, but not always though. Me, for example, I\u2019m really into literature when I was in high school, and I even told my literature teacher that I wanted to become a novelist. He encouraged me of course, yet he also told me it was one of the choices but not the only one. Now I end up becoming a DJ. I still love literature, and I often read, yet I love my job which is not so relevant to my favorite subject. So not a lot of people choose jobs that are relevant to their favorite school subject, but if they do, they\u2019re pretty lucky. So I think schools should allow students to make their own decisions about their future. (146 words)"}, "msg": "\u8bf7\u6c42\u6210\u529f\uff01"}
