This could be someone famous, someone close to you. What can you and others learn from this person\u2019s example?", "answer": "Family is the most precious thing for everyone. In my family, I admire my father most. He is the key person in our family and maintains the family in a solid way. He is my hero in my life. My father is truly an admirable person for his outstanding qualities. He has guided me to the right path so that I could shine in my career and personal life. When I was a kid, he helped me in all possible ways, when I turned a bit more mature he showed me the ways to choose. The most important thing is that he never forced me into doing something or performing after his will. He always left the issues to me, showed me the way, and I decided on the right road. With his advice, currently, I am an established photographer in society. He bought me the first camera of my life by cutting his costs in half when he came to know that I would like to be a photographer. My father has retired from his job and now passing his days with his family and friends. I admire my father and will continue doing so for his honesty, his sincerity, and sense of responsibility. I have never seen him ignore his responsibilities to my family. The most important feature of my father is sympathy for others regardless of relations. When someone in the family turned ill, he rushed to take care of the patient amid his thousands of responsibilities. He also used to help the destitute relations. I am truly lucky to have a father like him. (268 words)"}, "msg": "\u8bf7\u6c42\u6210\u529f\uff01"}
