How did you become good at this skill? How has this skill helped you?", "answer": "If I have to name a skill that I do really well, I think it would be writing. After graduated from university with a major in English, I still feel unstratified with my English writing skill, so I decided to go abroad and study for a master's degree in English. During my study, I have learned that writing well involves not just mastery of grammar but the development of the ability to organize one's thoughts into a coherent form and target it to an audience in the most effective way possible. So I dedicated myself more to learning and practicing writing. As a result, I can communicate with clarity by processing a good writing skill. Unlike talking, when I write, I look for more sophisticated words and expressions to describe what I have in mind. This helps me build a structure that will allow me to express myself better and communicate complex ideas in a much more effective way, which is also a useful skill that can help me work. A person who is a master of the written word can expect doors to open in just about every field.\uff08190 \u5b57\uff09"}, "msg": "\u8bf7\u6c42\u6210\u529f\uff01"}
