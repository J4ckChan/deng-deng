Nowadays, people living in my hometown are suffering heavily from pollution caused by the burning of fossil fuels, especially coal.

Moreover, the global warming phenomenon will also be eased, which otherwise, will lead to the rising of the sea level. Some islands, such as Bali, would be submerged if the current rising continues. If we take the action to stop using fossil fuels, I may still have the opportunities to travel to these islands.
