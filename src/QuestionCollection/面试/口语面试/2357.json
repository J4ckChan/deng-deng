What makes that event special to you? Who have you told about that memory, ad how did they respond?", "answer": "One of my favorite childhood memories was working alongside my dad when he fixed the family cars. Working with my dad taught me the value of hard work and sticking to a project until it is done right. Those moments in my childhood might seem small, but they have made hard work and stick-to-itiveness a significant part of who I am today. I shared this experience with my friends, and they have the same feelings as me. We all miss our childhoods. They were so great. You didn't have to deal with career, relationships, money, conspiracy, bills, depressions, loneliness, bills, fear, everything. Yet you didn't know, you were so eager to grow up, be an adult, and then think about your blissfully wonderful time with your parents and wish you could enjoy that pure happiness again.
