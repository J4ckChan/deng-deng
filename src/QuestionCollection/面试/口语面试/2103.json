Who were you with, and how was the experience? What did you learn about yourself from eating this unusual food?", "answer": "One evening, I was having dinner with my parents at home. My mother cooked a lobster for us in two different ways. It is very unusual for me because I have never seen her cooking this way and I have never eaten a lobster like this before. It was made into sashimi, and cooked with noodles and creamy sauce. I loved the experience especially when its a dinner with my family. What I have learned from this experience is that we should always give the best to our family and look after one another. Making unusual food for your family is a good way to express the love and improve the relationship between each member of the family.\uff08118 \u5b57\uff09"}, "msg": "\u8bf7\u6c42\u6210\u529f\uff01"}
