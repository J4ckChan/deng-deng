One is a high-paying job with long hours. The other is a low-paying job with few hours that would give you more free time. Which would you choose? Why? Give specific reasons for your answer.\"", "answer": "When it comes to the choice between a high-paying job with long hours and a low-paying job with few hours, I personally would pick the former. First of all, it is commonly acknowledged that money is an indispensable part of everyone's life. That is to say, the more money people have, the larger the variety of things they would be able to do. For instance, I can travel around the world only when I have got enough money. Therefore, a high-paying job is definitely what I would prefer. Additionally, longer working hours can fill out my everyday life and give me a strong sense of achievement because I get to accomplish more tasks and learn more things at work. To sum up, I would, for sure, choose a high-paying job with long hours. ", "difficulty": 2, "difficultyName": "\u4e00\u822c\uff08105~115\uff09"}, "msg": "\u8bf7\u6c42\u6210\u529f\uff01"}
