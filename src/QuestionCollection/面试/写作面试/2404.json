How did your help affect your friendship? How did helping someone else make you feel?", "answer": "We all need help at some point in our lives. I also receive help all the time and help others too. When we help others, it makes us happy. Today, I will talk about a time when I volunteered to help my friend Jack. Jack belongs to a low-income family. He didn't have enough money to buy books. And I used to receive some pocket money monthly in those days. Usually, I spent that money on chocolates, and I love chocolates. I decided to help him by using all my pocket money and bought a novel for him. I remembered how happy he was that day. Since then, we have become best friends. To be honest, I felt delighted, too, and that feeling was extremely different, which I never felt before. I realized that something could give me more happiness than eating chocolates, which is helping others to be happy. People who offer help to others can feel greater comfort and less stress. The giver, the helper, in turn, experiences a profound sense of satisfaction, of joy, of delight, of happiness, which decreases their stress levels as well.\uff08188 \u5b57\uff09"}, "msg": "\u8bf7\u6c42\u6210\u529f\uff01"}
