Include specific details.\"", "answer": "If I were asked about a major decision that I have made recently, I would tell you the following story. It was last year's winter, when one of my best friends, William, asked me if I would like to go skiing with him and a group of his friends, I didn't give him my answer straight away. Instead, I had a thorough thought over that plan for a couple of days because I had never been skiing before, and I hardly knew any of the other people in the group. Finally, I made my mind \u2013 I decided to join them and leave all the concerns behind. I suppose the most significant driver was the will to try playing extreme sports. The trip actually went smoothly, and I made many new friends along the way. If for any reason, I had chosen otherwise, I suppose that I would regret it so much once William came back from the snow mountain and showed me all the pictures and video clips he had shot when skiing. This is because I have actually experienced the great fun of skiing and viewed the amazingly gorgeous scenery of the snow mountain. Besides, I wouldn\u2019t have met so many amazing people who have taken good care of me and taught me how to ski. \uff08219 \u5b57\uff09", "difficulty": 1, "difficultyName": "\u7b80\u5355\uff08100\u4ee5\u4e0b\uff09"}, "msg": "\u8bf7\u6c42\u6210\u529f\uff01"}
