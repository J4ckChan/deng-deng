Explain your reasoning.", "answer": "As far as I am concerned, people should always strive for something better. Because when we're content, we fall behind. We don't bother to strive for improvement because we think this is the best we can have or be. Don't get me wrong \u2013 of course, it's important to be thankful and happy with what you have and who you are. But be careful not to fall behind, not to want to be better. When everyone is content with the current situation, the civilization will ultimately stop progressing, which would rather horrible. Progress is our north star. It gives us a place to move towards, and with it, a sense of purpose and meaning. At a deeper level, the idea of progress protects us from our existential fear of meaninglessness, from the vastness that comes with just being here, one now at a time. If we are not heading somewhere else, somewhere better, then we are left simply with this moment, heading nowhere in particular. Therefore, it is better to always strive for something better.
