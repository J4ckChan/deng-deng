Provide reasons to support your opinion.", "answer": "Some people contend that school is the right place to learn knowledge as well as moral values like respect, obedience, and honesty. I tend to disagree with this opinion. In my view, parents should guide their children on how to be a good member of society rather than teachers. The main reason is that children spend more time at home mimicking parents so parents should make some good examples. Moreover, children mostly look at teachers as some outsiders who would teach them the academic lessons, not personal values. Thirdly, teachers, who spend limited time with each child, sometimes do not know the students' own choices; thus, they cannot evaluate them correctly. As a result, schools should stick to core subjects. (121 \u5b57)"}, "msg": "\u8bf7\u6c42\u6210\u529f\uff01"}
