What is the most important thing for the house to have? How would that thing make your days easier or more enjoyable?", "answer": "Everyone has a dream house in mind where they want to live in, and I am no different in that regard. The dream house I want to live in would be a two-story simple house in the middle of my farm surrounded by trees and agricultural land. I grew up on a farm, and it instilled in me the appreciation for nature. The house I want would have four bedrooms, a living room, and a spacious modern style kitchen. In the backyard, I would like to plant flowers and have an English garden. I would also like to plant seasonal vegetables and fruits as I prefer organic food over market produce. I want a simple house lacking ostentation. However, there are things that I would want no matter what. For example, I would like a dishwasher as I don\u2019t like doing dishes. Also, every room in the house should get sunshine every day, especially my bedroom and living room. Another facility I want is an open bar in the basement where I can entertain friends and guests as I am a very outgoing person. In conclusion, my dream house would be one home with four bedrooms in the middle of the farm I grew up in. I prefer that location because I have a deep emotional connection to the land and community there.\uff08225 \u5b57\uff09"}, "msg": "\u8bf7\u6c42\u6210\u529f\uff01"}
