Autonomy in the workplace refers to how much freedom employees have while working. For some organizations, autonomy means employees are allowed to set their schedules. In other organizations, autonomy means employees can decide how their work should be done. No matter which concept is being applied, higher levels of autonomy tend to result in an increase in job satisfaction. Research shows that when employees are given the freedom associated with autonomy, job satisfaction rises. It's theorized that this increased level of job satisfaction in employees stems from a feeling of greater responsibility for the quality of their work. Autonomy has also been shown to increase motivation and happiness, along with decreasing employee turnover. From what has been discussed above, we may safely draw the conclusion that employees will have better work performance if they are given more autonomy.
