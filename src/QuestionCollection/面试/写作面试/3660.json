Why do you think this story made the news? What do you think people can learn from the story?", "answer": "I read about a strange news story last week which is kind of funny. A man in France has accidentally blown up part of his house while trying to chase a fly with an electric swat. The man, in his 80s, was eating his dinner on Friday evening when he became annoyed at a fly buzzing around him. He then picked up the electronic fly swat and took aim at it, as he was unaware of a gas cylinder leaking at his home. A reaction occurred between the swat and the gas, causing an explosion and part of his kitchen to blow up. The blast also damaged a section of his roof and the house is currently uninhabitable. Somehow the man managed to escape the catastrophe with just a burn to his hand. As to why this story made the news, I suppose it was because no such thing had ever happened before - a coincidentally weird but highly dangerous incident resulted from an ordinary, daily practice with a surprising ending. What people can learn from the story is that they should always keep an eye on their living environment and keep it at an absolutely safe level. (198\u5b57)"}, "msg": "\u8bf7\u6c42\u6210\u529f\uff01"}
