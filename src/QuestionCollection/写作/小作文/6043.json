Do you agree or disagree? Why? Give specific reasons for your answer.\"", "answer": "A business should not be so shameless and cruel to do whatever it can to make a profit. Although profit is very vital for the business to survive, for a long-term reputation, the business should always follow the legislation, consider being sustainable to the environment, and be ethical. To gain a good reputation, a business should always behave appropriately. This reputation can help to generate long-term income and cash flow for the business as people trust the company, and people would like to purchase products and services from this company. Hence, a company should always consider moral and ethical issues when making a profit.
