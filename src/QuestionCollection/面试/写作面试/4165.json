What did you do to find it? How did you try to make sure you would not lose it again?", "answer": "One day I was taking a taxi home and had a lot on my mind. It wasn't until I got home and wanted to use my phone that I realized my phone had gone missing. I looked everywhere at home but couldn't find it. I must had left it on the taxi then. I then rang my own number over and over using the home phone. After several attempts the driver answered. I asked if he would be kind enough to bring it back to me. I felt relieved and beyond lucky that the driver said yes. Finally, I got my mobile phone back. It was critically important to me because I literally did everything with my phone, from texting messages to calling and even banking, and what's more, I stored much of my personal information in it. I had to make sure that it stayed with me all the time by holding it firmly in my hand or checking regularly it is in one of my pockets so that I won't lose it again.
