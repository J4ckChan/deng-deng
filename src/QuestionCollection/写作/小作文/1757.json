Do you agree or disagree? Why? Give specific reasons for your answer.\"", "answer": "There is an ongoing debate about whether people do things out of their own will or because they are expected to do so by others. From my point of view, it is easy to find out that people always do things because they want to do so. There are several reasons that contribute to my idea. Firstly, inner motivation is the biggest factor that affects our decision. All we do is satisfy our own needs. For example, people go to work either because they need the money to survive or they enjoy the feeling of being needed. To sum up, I strongly believe that people choose to do things because of their own needs. \uff08115 \u5b57\uff09", "difficulty": 3, "difficultyName": "\u96be\uff08120\u4ee5\u4e0a\uff09"}, "msg": "\u8bf7\u6c42\u6210\u529f\uff01"}
