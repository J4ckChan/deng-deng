Explain how you can live successfully within a culture different from your own.", "answer": "As one of the world's most ancient civilizations, China is rich in traditions and unique customs. The Chinese New Year, or Spring Festival, is the happiest time of the year for nearly all children in China. No matter what region or background their families are from, they normally receive \"hongbao,\" also known as lucky money. Lucky money usually consists of brand-new bills put in a red envelope and given by the family's elders. The lucky money represents blessings for the year to come. People tend to stop receiving lucky money when they begin to work, but in some parts of China, for example, Guangdong and Hong Kong, people can receive lucky money until they get married. Giving lucky money to children is one of China's unique cultures, but in Australia, there is nothing like it. People tend to combine Christmas and the New Year vacations together and spend it with families or travel to other countries. So I need to adapt to these different cultures and adjust myself to get used to the fact that no one is going to give me the lucky money during New Year's celebration. So I always organize a trip with friends, either travel within Australia or go abroad. The New Years' time can also be an ideal time for me to relax with friends, just like the Australians.\uff08224 \u5b57\uff09"}, "msg": "\u8bf7\u6c42\u6210\u529f\uff01"}
