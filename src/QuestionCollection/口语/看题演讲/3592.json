It accommodates more than 200 million people. And it is now changing in a lot of aspects among which the most noticeable are public facilities that people live in the city are using on a frequent basis. For instance, the state government and local council are putting a joint effort into improving the current public transportation system. A large number of new trains have been put into use on the most popular lines in an attempt to increase the capacity to mitigate the rush hour congestion. Meanwhile, they are working tirelessly to roll out more light rails and trams. The major reason for implementing this change is that there have been numerous complaints about public transport over the past decade. And the government has realized that they have to do something to make this city more liveable and more agreeable.
