Do you agree or disagree? Give specific reasons for your answer.\"", "answer": "The quality of education is very important in our life. When many people argue that parents teach their children better than teachers do, others think that professional teachers are more qualified. I completely agree that parents are the best teachers in the world because they put the foundation and moral value in children\u2019s life. I strongly believe that the basis of human life is founded on our parents. In other words, school starts at 6 years old, and at this age, children already have the essential knowledge about society such as community pillars because of their parents. Therefore, parents are always the best teachers.", "difficulty": 2, "difficultyName": "\u4e00\u822c\uff08105~115\uff09"}, "msg": "\u8bf7\u6c42\u6210\u529f\uff01"}
