Explain your reasoning.", "answer": "The controversial issue in respect of the impact of technology has attracted huge public attention and sparked a heated debate. Some people argue that technology has made living more complicated as people are now required to learn a broad spectrum of skills relating to new technology. As far as I am concerned, technology has made our life much easier than it was decades ago. I can cite a convincing example of the invention of the computer. One of the most conspicuous effects that computers have brought to our life is that they have largely increased people's work efficiency. This is to say; computer software can free people from repetitive work, which was time-consuming in the days preceding the invention of the computer. What's more, computers allow people to communicate and work anytime without the restriction of geographic locations. For instance, people can now work from home in cases where it isn't so convenient to get to the office. The outbreak of pandemic worldwide in 2020 has witnessed the unparalleled advantages of using technology. Additionally, it is an indisputable fact that people are now able to carry out highly sophisticated work with a high level of accuracy by using a computer. According to joint research conducted by Time Magazine, 50% of the experiments that involve great complexity can now be completed with the aid of computers. To put it in a nutshell, due to the factors outlined above, I can safely draw the conclusion that technology has made life much easier for people.\uff08252 \u5b57\uff09"}, "msg": "\u8bf7\u6c42\u6210\u529f\uff01"}
