The main reasoning behind this is that children should be treated as independent people and considered a member of society. If we consider children dependent on parents, it will have negative impacts on their development. As a consequence, when children break the law, because they are independent, they should be responsible for their own mistakes. Moreover, facing consequences, such as prison sentences, could well prevent these children from breaking the law again. However, if parents are held accountable for their children\u2019s mistakes and these children do not need to face consequences, they might commit a crime again. Therefore, children should be held accountable if they break the law.", "referenceText": "Should parents be held accountable if their children break the law?
