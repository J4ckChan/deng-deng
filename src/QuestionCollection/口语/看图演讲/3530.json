She is holding a glass kettle that contains liquid and pouring liquid into an empty large bottle through a funnel. This girl is so focused on the process as she is stirring at the funnel and trying to pour the liquid as steadily as she can. From the picture, I can see she also put several newspapers on the ground and press them with a stand, in case the liquid would splash out. There are also other tools placed around her. This picture has reminded me of the first chemistry experiments I did in high school. At that time, we need to pour the acid into a test tube. Since the acid is corrosive, we were all wearing gloves and goggles. The experiments are always so interesting since we can explore the whole process, check the results and learn the principles by ourselves.
