People are continuously looking for ways to get things done more easily and quickly. And with an increasing focus on science and technology, numerous amounts of funding are going into research in these fields. Therefore, every time a new invention comes out, the old generation of equipment inevitably becomes obsolete since it is outperformed by the former. For instance, a newly invented the thermometer can precisely take the temperature of an object in 1/10th of a second simply by scanning it.
