The boy is naked to the waist and wears a pair of blue shorts, which indicates that he is taking part in water-related activities, and I suppose it must be a hot sunny day. The picture is quite interesting as it captures the exact moment when the boy's entire body is in the air. All of his hair is standing upwards because of the wind created while he is pouncing forward. And his facial expression indicates that he is rather thrilled. He must be enjoying the play very much. The inflated air mattress is purple and orange and has soap water poured on it to make it slippery for easy sliding. In the background, there are a number of other kids and adults lining up for their turn. They all wear beachwear. And the green color in the background tells me that the activity is probably being held on a lawn.
