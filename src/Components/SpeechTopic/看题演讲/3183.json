I hate shopping with my mother because I tend to browse a number of stores before making my final decision, but she isn't very patient. On the other hand, Mary always tells me when she thinks a color doesn't suit me. But my mother is like \"Okay, okay, it's perfect, you don't need to try another, come on, come on, let's go\" which is kind of annoying. I bought a plain white cotton shirt, a yellow top, and a light blue coat. I love my new coat. Generally, I go shopping once or twice a month. Depending on the day, I like to shop at shopping centers or in local shops. And I usually go shopping when there are discounts, bargains or sales. I haven't got a lot of money and I am also saving money to pay my fees at university.
