Why do you think this person's life would be enjoyable for you? What would you hope to learn in that week?", "answer": "If I could change places with another person for a week, I would swap with my cousin. This is because she is a very successful businesswoman. She is a manager in a multinational company where she gets to travel frequently around the world. Meanwhile, she earns more than enough money to have a comfortable life. What's more, she is rather pretty and elegant. She is quite sociable and extroverted, so people very much enjoy spending time with her. I really hope that I can learn some of her interpersonal skills as I have always been bad at interacting with people. If I could change places with her for a week, I suppose I could travel to New York on a business trip, staying in decent hotel her company has reserved for her, dinning in a highly-rated restaurant while meeting clients, etc. After the work is completed, I could probably visit famous tourist attraction there, and do some shopping as well. How wonderful it would be! (165\u5b57)"}, "msg": "\u8bf7\u6c42\u6210\u529f\uff01"}
