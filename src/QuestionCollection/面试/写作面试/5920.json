Explain your reasoning.", "answer": "In my opinion, I would prefer to leave the offensive language as they are. The first reason is the context is high school reading materials, high school students are already mature enough to filter information, and they know how to use proper language over different contexts. Secondly, offensive language is significant in literacies. Sometimes, literacy techniques including sarcastic, ironic, and hyperbole could be offensive. In addition, sometimes the author deliberately chooses to be offensive to be reflexive on the tragic reality. Hence, they should be left as they are as offensive language is an important literacy feature."}, "msg": "\u8bf7\u6c42\u6210\u529f\uff01"}
