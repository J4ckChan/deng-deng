What did you think of the experience? What are some benefits of spending time outside?", "answer": "The last time I did something fun outdoors was when I played tennis for 7 hours on a weekend day with my friends. It was three weeks ago when the weather finally turned sunny after a few weeks of rain. I think the experience was great as we were all fully rested and looked forward to it. There are a lot of benefits to spending time outside. Exposure to the sunshine and sweating is healthy. Spending time with friends is also important as it is essential for social life."}, "msg": "\u8bf7\u6c42\u6210\u529f\uff01"}
