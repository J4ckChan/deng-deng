Were you excited to visit this place? What did you like most about this place when you arrived?", "answer": "The most famous place I have visited is the forbidden city. It is located in Beijing and is the place for the emperors of the Qing dynasty. I was so excited to visit this place because it is a famous historical site in China, and recorded the close history. The architectural style is the thing I like the most about this place. It's got a completely wooden structure for the constructions and the colors are typical Chinese wall red. It is a record of the remarkably Chinese traditional design and very detailed construction style."}, "msg": "\u8bf7\u6c42\u6210\u529f\uff01"}
