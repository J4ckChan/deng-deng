What are some benefits and drawbacks to either?", "answer": "Works of art can provide clear information and themes. To some extent, works of art can represent the theme of an era. The information and themes it can provide are of great significance to the progress and development of the times. However, as an artist in the new era, we should not be restricted by historical works. It is the true proposition of art to dare to create. Therefore, art can provide space for many people. Art comes from life but is also higher than life. With the development of art, I believe that more and more kinds of art will emerge."}, "msg": "\u8bf7\u6c42\u6210\u529f\uff01"}
