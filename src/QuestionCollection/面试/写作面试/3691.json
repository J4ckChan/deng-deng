How has this similarity impacted your relationship? What do you think this similarity says about how your parents influence you?", "answer": "When it comes to a trait that I got from one of my parents, I suppose it would my father's trustworthiness. He is a person of his word. He would not talk much but when he does it carries unparallel weights. I love him and admire him so much that I want to become a person like him. Trustworthiness is the foundation element in any interpersonal relationship. Each time I am assigned a task, I will complete it within the given timeframe and to a high standard. As a result, I earned others' trust and forged healthy relationships. Regarding this similarity, among others, my father has influenced me positively, for which I am truly grateful. He has raised me to be a good person, a person who can be relied on by others. (133\u5b57)"}, "msg": "\u8bf7\u6c42\u6210\u529f\uff01"}
