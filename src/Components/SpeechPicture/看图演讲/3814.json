She is grasping the handle of the tripod and trying to look through it with her left eye while the right one is closed as if the handle is the lens cone. And she is also placing her right hand up to the side of the tripod in such a way that it seems like she is adjusting a knob that is for the focus of the telescope. The girl is wearing a pink long-sleeved shirt on which there is a cartoon character. Behind her, there is a dark brown basket, a toy baby, and a flight of stairs.
