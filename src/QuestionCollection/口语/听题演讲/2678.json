It was last year that I had a trip to New Zealand with my friends, it was during winter, and we have planned to ski as we have never tried before. After we arrived at the hotel, we watched the weather forecast that it was going to be a nice day, which is suitable for skiing, skating, or snowshoes hiking. We felt so excited that we even couldn't sleep, as we have planned and expected for months. We kept talking about it until midnight. However, the weather forecast has given us a big joke; it was snowing heavily! It seems that there was countless snow anxiously to fall on the ground. Trees, buildings, cars, everything was covered in white, and it was a snow-filled sky that we can hardly see the sun. We turned on the TV, the news was telling people that it was going to snow all day, and people are recommended to stay at home. It was obvious that our plans have been disrupted by this unexpected snow. So we have to make another plan instead and stayed in the hotel. We ordered pizza delivery and played board games, video games, and chat. It turned out that staying in the room and playing games was also a very good option as we laughed and talked like we were never going to stop. Although we didn't have the chance to ski, it was still a memorable moment for us. \uff08266 \u5b57\uff09", "referenceText": "Describe a time bad weather disrupted your plans.
