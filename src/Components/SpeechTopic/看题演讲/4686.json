She had chosen a university far away from our hometown, which made it difficult for her to spend any time with our parents. Especially the older they are getting, the more regret she becomes. She told me if she could go back to the time when choosing a university, she will choose the one near our hometown. A close family ensures everyone feels loved, supported, and strong. So, whatever life throws your way, you'll always be able to overcome it with the strength of the family unit. As one of the famous experts says, \"At the end of your life, you will never regret not having passed one more test, not winning one more verdict, or not closing one more deal. You will regret time not spent with a husband, a friend, a child, a parent.\" (165\u5b57)", "options": [{"content": "Who was this person?"}, {"content": "What was the situation?"}, {"content": "What decision did they make, and why was it bad?"}], "difficulty": 1, "difficultyName": "\u7b80\u5355\uff08100\u4ee5\u4e0b\uff09"}, "msg": "\u8bf7\u6c42\u6210\u529f\uff01"}
