Why do you enjoy it? What is one thing that could be improved in your neighborhood, and how would it benefit the residents?", "answer": "My neighbors and I are not only sharing a real community, but also sharing a virtual community. In fact, we communicate most of the time online. Because we are living in a time that neighbors tend not to keep in touch. However, in the community that I am currently living in, my neighbors actually communicate quite often! I actually found that amusing! But if I have to point out one thing that I am not quite fancy about my own neighborhood, it would be the current way how some of my neighbors practice recycling. If you wonder what do I mean, pay a visit to the rubbish room and you will have all the answers. Some of my neighbors just do not know how to practice recycling, and when I see such bad practices, it really irritates me. I really wish that these residents can spend some time watching online tutorials about how to recycle waste at home and improve their practices! By doing that, not only can we reduce waste, but also help save our beloved planet! \n"}, "msg": "\u8bf7\u6c42\u6210\u529f\uff01"}
