How could these places improve your neighborhood? What kinds of activities could your family and friends enjoy in these public spaces?", "answer": "The public parks and community gardens of cities have provided open space to improve our physical and psychological health, strengthen our communities, and make our cities and neighborhoods more attractive places to live and work. Numerous studies have shown the social, environmental, economic, and health benefits parks bring to a city and its people. For example, they attract tourists, serve as community signature pieces, offer a marketing tool for cities to attract businesses and conventions, and host festivals, concerts, and athletics events. Above all, green space in urban areas provides substantial ecosystem services. All of these are the benefits that can help to improve our neighborhood, as well as provide a better living environment for residents. The public parks and community gardens are the ideal places for my family and friends to enjoy our time; we can bring fruits and snacks to have a picnic on the green grass, play frisbee with our dogs, or enjoy the outdoor music concert.\uff08160 \u5b57\uff09"}, "msg": "\u8bf7\u6c42\u6210\u529f\uff01"}
