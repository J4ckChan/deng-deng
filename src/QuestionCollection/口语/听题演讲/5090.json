Controlling pollutions has become an urgent request to implement, no matter for human beings, animals, or the climate. In the place where I live, there is serious air pollution. From no matter visual or olfactory feel, the air pollution is just like normal fog. However, it contains so many harmful particles that you cannot see, cannot smell. Those particles can only be identified using professional testing equipment. You cannot examine the harm by bare eyes and feels, but the harmful particles are invading your lungs all the time while you are breathing. Also, chemical emissions from factories polluted not only the air but also the water. The water has heavy metals and may be poisonous to humans and animals. To change this horrible situation, factories should produce using clean energy and the government should promote green energy technology such as solar energy or wind and water power.", "referenceText": "Talk about environmental pollution in the place where you live.
