How did you decide what to do? How did your decision impact your relationship with the person?", "answer": "Last time, I had an argument with my parents. They wanted me to purchase a home and stop paying rent but I rejected them. The reason why I made the decision to keep renting instead of buying a property is that I would like to enjoy more financial flexibility. If I purchase a house, I will have to take on a mortgage which will get me in debt. However, it will not make me happy. On the other hand, if I do not buy or own any properties, I would have more opportunities to keep accumulating my savings and enjoy more financial flexibility. After I told my parents about my final decision and explained to them the reasons, they decided to support me. Also, they started to realize that not owning a house might not be as bad as they thought."}, "msg": "\u8bf7\u6c42\u6210\u529f\uff01"}
