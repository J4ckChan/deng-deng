Provide reasons to support your opinion.", "answer": "I think everyone has the right to cover their personal information if he or she wants. Sometimes you just don't want anyone to know who you really are. Even if you aren't involved in anything illegal or questionable. There's a level of social safety that comes with anonymity. And that can be really important for introverts in online communities. But more than that, imagine if you were a celebrity with global recognition. It can be tiresome to have paparazzi everywhere and no room for being alone. Online anonymity also plays an important role in freedom of expression. One of the most amazing things about the internet is that it can give voices to those who are actively being silenced. This allows them to speak without fear of repercussion. So based on the arguments above, I think disguising identities online is definitely necessary. (142 words)"}, "msg": "\u8bf7\u6c42\u6210\u529f\uff01"}
