Each of them is given a round plate, and there are creamy cake-like desserts on the plate. Also, the top of the desserts is scattered with much black stuff, which I cannot tell exactly what it is. I guess it's probably chocolate chip. It seems that they are playing some kind of game that requires them to eat up the dessert without using their hands. Therefore, all of them have put their hands away from the table in order not to break the rule. Now they can only eat the desserts with their mouths, either by licking or biting. I can imagine how hard it is by looking at their faces \u2013 the cream is all around their mouths and even on the tip of their noses while the desserts haven't been eaten to a half. What a fun game it is! \uff08178 \u5b57\uff09", "photo": "https://cdn.51ddedu.com/images/477110157222875136.jpg", "difficulty": 2, "difficultyName": "\u4e00\u822c\uff08105~115\uff09"}, "msg": "\u8bf7\u6c42\u6210\u529f\uff01"}
