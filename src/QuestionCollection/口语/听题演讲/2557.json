Many factors are contributing to lower infant mortality rates, though they can be broadly grouped into factors associated with economic growth and poverty reduction, and expanded social services including improved standards and access to health care. In developing nations, household income and a mother's education level are key factors determining infant and child mortality rates. Increased immunization rates are also an important factor. On the other hand, the mortality rate among adults is associated with noncommunicable diseases. And it is increasing in many countries due to increases in life expectancy, you know the population aging, and the associated health transitions which are contributing to increased incidence of non-communicable diseases, which are called NCDs for short. Rising income in some countries also appears to be increasing the prevalence of risk factors for NCDs, such as high blood pressure and obesity. Smoking also continues to play a large role in NCD rates throughout the world. Nonetheless, in many developing nations, and notably in the tropical areas, communicable diseases remain a significant health burden. \uff08202 \u5b57\uff09", "referenceText": "What factors might contribute to a high mortality rate in a region or a country?", "referenceTranslate": "\u4ec0\u4e48\u56e0\u7d20\u53ef\u80fd\u5bfc\u81f4\u4e00\u4e2a\u5730\u533a\u6216\u56fd\u5bb6\u7684\u9ad8\u6b7b\u4ea1\u7387?", "difficulty": 3, "difficultyName": "\u96be\uff08120\u4ee5\u4e0a\uff09"}, "msg": "\u8bf7\u6c42\u6210\u529f\uff01"}
