Provide reasons to support your opinion.", "answer": "Nowadays, the controversial issue in relation to the relationship between violent media and violence has drawn great public attention and launched a heated debate. Some worry that there is a direct link, while others are concerned that these kinds of activities simply isolate people or have addictive potential. The biggest fear many players and clinicians have is that exposure to games or visual media with violent content may turn ordinary people, especially kids, into violent people in the real world. As far as I am concerned, exposure to violent content does not necessarily cause violent behaviour. I, personally, have watched many R-rated movies like Parasite, 1917, etc. I have played many violent video games like Fortnite and Battlefront. I play and watch violent media, but I know that it is only entertaining, not something meant to be copied. In fact, I know a kid who plays GTA 5 and he is a nice person. You can consume such media, and still be a good person. Many other developed countries like Japan, UK, and many more have violent media, but their homicide rates are not high, and some are even rather low. It shows that media doesn't necessarily make you violent. The high homicide rates in some countries, America, for instance, can attribute the lack of proper gun control. As for children, if parents are going to show them violent media, tell kids that media is only meant to be entertaining, and that in real life, violence is not okay, and make sure they understand the consequences of real world violence.
