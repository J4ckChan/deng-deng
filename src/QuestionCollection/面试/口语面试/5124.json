What made the story funny? Who did you share the story with, and how did they respond?", "answer": "The last story that made me laugh was from a Korean TV series, named Hometown Cha-Cha-Cha. In the series, the main actor told the main actress a very funny joke and it made me chuckle a lot. After I heard this joke, I called my friend and shared the story with her. After she heard the joke, she started to laugh none-stop as well. So, both my friend and I really enjoyed this joke."}, "msg": "\u8bf7\u6c42\u6210\u529f\uff01"}
