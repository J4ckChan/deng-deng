Explain why you would choose one form of craft over others.", "answer": "There are many different types of crafts, such as woodworking, knitting, embroidery, and pottery. If I were to choose a craft that I am interested in pursuing, I would choose woodworking. Woodworking is a real skill that can benefit me and those around me. This new skill can be applied however I see fit because wood is everywhere in our life. Think about how many things are made out of wood, and it quickly becomes apparent that the possibilities are endless with this material. Not only can I build practically anything out of wood, but I can also choose the type of wood and color and apply whatever finish I see fit."}, "msg": "\u8bf7\u6c42\u6210\u529f\uff01"}
