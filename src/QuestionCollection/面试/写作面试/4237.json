Provide reasons to support your opinion.", "answer": "As far as I am concerned, face-to-face learning has a number of advantages that online education cannot replicate. While it may be easy to adapt to online learning for mainstream theoretical subjects, that is not the case for an array of disciplines and fields that students seek to specialise in. Online learning takes away valuable resources such as lab facilities and studios - resources that are essential for some subjects and cannot be recreated at home. For vocational majors like theatre, film, music, dance and a whole bunch of others, the switch to online learning is taking away more than it can provide. Being on campus also allows classes to have field visits in the area of their study, allowing them to observe real-life applications of the subjects they are studying. This, too, cannot be replaced by online classes. (138\u5b57)"}, "msg": "\u8bf7\u6c42\u6210\u529f\uff01"}
