Explain your reasoning.", "answer": "I believe students should primarily read non-fiction because students should focus on their academic ability in order to cope with the high demands from universities. It does not mean that students should never read literature, but literature is somehow irrelevant for students who do not aim to do artistic work, for example, writing fiction. If students have enough leisure time, then fiction is a good way to relax and to inspire them. Other reasons for focusing more on reading non-fiction would be extending students knowledge of different content areas and improving their academic writing skills. Especially for students who aim to achieve higher level of education such as a doctorate, they should read research paper more often rather than distracting themselves by too much fiction.
