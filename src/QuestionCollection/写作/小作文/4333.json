It is a rather simple dish which I learned to cook quickly. The ingredients I need are spaghetti, pasta source, red onion, and pork mince. Firstly, fill a large pot with water and bring the water to a boil. Add spaghetti into the water and cook for 10 minutes. Meanwhile, dice the red onion. Then, drain the water. Heat a pan, add oil, and then fry the pork mince till its color changes. Add red onion dice into the pan and keep frying for another minute. Finally, add spaghetti and pasta source into the pan and stir fry for two minutes.
