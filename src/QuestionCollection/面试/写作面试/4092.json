Explain your reasoning.", "answer": "The controversial issue concerning complaint has launched a heated debate on whether it is better to complain when something isn't right. As far as I am concerned, I tend to be an advocate regarding this issue. That is to say, it is necessary for us to appreciate and value the things we possess, but when something bad happens, we should not just accept it. If people don't complain at all, then the bad thing will keep occurring consistently, which will lead to many serious consequences. Overall, the available evidence clearly leads to the conclusion that people should complain when something is not right. (103\u5b57)"}, "msg": "\u8bf7\u6c42\u6210\u529f\uff01"}
