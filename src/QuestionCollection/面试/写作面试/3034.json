Why?", "answer": "During the course of studying abroad, I had to share an apartment with someone. After 9 years of renting, I had encountered a broad spectrum of people, and sometimes the flatmates could be very different from myself in terms of our characteristics and lifestyle. Therefore, I had to adjust myself to cope with such situation. I am going to talk about my current flatmate. He is rather lazy, and he rarely does cleaning at home. Every time he cooks, he leaves a big mess in the kitchen: sauces, ingredients and cookware all over the bench. When he finishes eating or drinking, he leaves all the cups, plates, bowls and cutleries in the sink. And 9 out 10 times, after washing or drying his clothes, he forgets to take them out of the machine. What's worse, he even uses the washing machine to wash his rugs and cat's accessories, which turns the washing machine into a hair collector. Those things really annoy me, because apart from our separate bedrooms and bathrooms, we share all the other common areas and facilities. This being said, most of the time, my flatmate is a quite nice person, and as I am a caring and moderate person, I usually take care of the mess he has made and never complain to him.
