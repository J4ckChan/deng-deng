Why do you think that people want to be famous? Is it more important to be kind or to be popular? Explain the reasons for your choice.", "answer": "Being famous can be beneficial, but I think the disadvantages will outweigh the advantages. Being famous means no privacy. People can never go anywhere in public without having crowds of people follow them and having cameras in their face. While, there are many people who still pursue fame and compliments, because they are indulged by their own fans, followers, and worshipers. When choosing between popularity and kindness, I am inclined to the latter one. The main reason is that being kind can build a genuine relationship between people. Someone will remember that you helped them out last time and therefore be more likely to help you in the future. \uff08109 \u5b57\uff09"}, "msg": "\u8bf7\u6c42\u6210\u529f\uff01"}
