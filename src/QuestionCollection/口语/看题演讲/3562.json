After moving to a coastal city, I find many local residents enjoy swimming in the sea. And I can teach my children how to swim and play with them in the future if I can obtain this skill myself. In order to learn swimming, the first step is to conquer my fear of water. Then, I am going to enroll in a swimming class so that I can establish a foundation for swimming. If I can master the most basic swimming stroke, breaststroke, I would like to challenge the freestyle and backstroke. From my friend's experience, keeping swimming as a habit can also benefit the entire body by increasing heart rate without stressing muscles. Learning a new skill is always interesting as it indicates a new adventure.
