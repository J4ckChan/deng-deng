Use examples from your personal experience and observations to support your opinion.", "answer": "Reading is important for children's development and I believe that it is essential to encourage students to read in their free time. This is because reading allows us to be transported from our own world to another. Between the pages of a book, we can become immersed in the lives of fictional characters and learn about a culture entirely different from our own. We can also learn new words and phrases, experience a range of emotions, and acquire skills and knowledge. In conclusion, we should always encourage children to read no matter what genre it is."}, "msg": "\u8bf7\u6c42\u6210\u529f\uff01"}
