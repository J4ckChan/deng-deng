How old were you, and who was with you? What is the happiest part of this memory?", "answer": "When I was eight years old and my family took our first big vacation to Florida to go to Disney World. This was my favorite vocation because it was the first time my family had ever been anywhere far away together. I was overwhelmed with all the shops, vendors, and especially the castle! My favorite part was that I can actually meet the characters, Goofy was my favorite! I\u2019ll never forget that vacation and I can\u2019t wait to make new vacation memories!\uff0886 \u5b57\uff09"}, "msg": "\u8bf7\u6c42\u6210\u529f\uff01"}
