It was my father's scooter, and I liked it a lot. For serval times, I asked my father to let me ride it, but he always refused. The other day, I tried to ride the scooter while my father was away. Since I used to watch my father riding it, I thought it would be easy to handle. However, I ended up bumping into the wall nearby and got one of my legs severely injured. I was bleeding a lot and couldn't move. Fortunately, my mother spotted me and immediately took me to the hospital. Also, the scooter was crashed badly. The whole incident was a big lesson for me. I learned that I should never do anything without the permission of others, especially when I have little or no experience in doing it, as people tend to underestimate the risk involved.
