Provide reasons to support your opinion.", "answer": "\u201cA picture is worth a thousand words\" is an English language adage meaning that complex and sometimes multiple ideas can be conveyed by a single still image, which conveys its meaning or essence more effectively than a mere verbal description. I totally agree with this sentence. As humans, we are largely responsive to visual pictures, whether we like to admit it or not. Pictures have the ability to make us feel happy, excited, disgusted, and curious, among other things. We can remember a famous brand just by looking at their image and can even reminisce about 10, 20, 30 years into the past to a moment in our lives where we were affected emotionally by a specific event simply by looking at an old picture. Images can also warn us or give us clues about what's to come. Along with powerfully emotional headlines, pictures that capture stunning moments in time stand prominently in our view peaking our curiosity and changing our mood instantly.
