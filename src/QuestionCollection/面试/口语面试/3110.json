What do you usually do online? What is one thing you think should change about how people use the internet?", "answer": "As far as I am concerned, the biggest benefit of having constant access to the internet is that it largely facilitates people's study. 20 years ago, whenever I wanted to learn about something, I had to ask someone or to visit the local library. Things are so different now, and even though having access to the internet is just a part of daily life, it still is amazing. I can learn pretty much anything online. There are experts and experienced people sharing knowledge freely online. It is easy for people to get caught up in the busyness of life. We often take things for granted and fail to notice and appreciate the abundance and there is always something to be thankful for in our lives. Therefore, we need to appreciate the tings around us, and my way to show thankfulness is to say \"thank you\" to those who share good stuff online.
