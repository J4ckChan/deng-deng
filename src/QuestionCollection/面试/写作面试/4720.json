Provide reasons to support your opinion.", "answer": "As far as I am concerned, learning should be made fun. The most important reason is that making learning fun is a sure way to get students to remember information better. This is because fun means engagement, and doing and learning what has meaning and purpose. When students are engaged and motivated, they can achieve higher levels of cognition, make connections and experience more memorable moments. When students are engaged and having fun, they turn on their effective information processing and long-term memory storage, and hence the information is retained. Instead of quiet classrooms and directed lectures, long-term learning is better promoted in classrooms with an atmosphere of exuberant discovery.
