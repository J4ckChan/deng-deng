Almost all globular proteins are soluble and many are enzymes. Fibrous proteins are often structural, such as collagen, the major component of connective tissue, or keratin, the protein component of hair and nails. Membrane proteins often serve as receptors or provide channels for polar or charged molecules to pass through the cell membrane.", "answer": "\u86cb\u767d\u8d28\u53ef\u4ee5\u975e\u6b63\u5f0f\u5730\u5206\u4e3a\u4e09\u4e2a\u4e3b\u8981\u7c7b\u522b\uff0c\u5b83\u4eec\u4e0e\u5178\u578b\u7684\u4e09\u7ea7\u7ed3\u6784\u76f8\u5173\uff1a\u7403\u72b6\u86cb\u767d\u3001\u7ea4\u7ef4\u86cb\u767d\u548c\u819c\u86cb\u767d\u3002\u51e0\u4e4e\u6240\u6709\u7684\u7403\u72b6\u86cb\u767d\u8d28\u90fd\u662f\u53ef\u6eb6\u6027\u7684\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d\u8bb8\u591a\u662f\u9176\u3002\u7ea4\u7ef4\u86cb\u767d\u901a\u5e38\u662f\u7ed3\u6784\u6027\u7684\uff0c\u6bd4\u5982\u7ed3\u7f14\u7ec4\u7ec7\u7684\u4e3b\u8981\u6210\u5206\u80f6\u539f\u86cb\u767d\uff0c\u6216\u8005\u89d2\u86cb\u767d\uff0c\u5934\u53d1\u548c\u6307\u7532\u7684\u86cb\u767d\u8d28\u6210\u5206\u3002\u819c\u86cb\u767d\u901a\u5e38\u4f5c\u4e3a\u53d7\u4f53\u6216\u4e3a\u6781\u6027\u6216\u5e26\u7535\u5206\u5b50\u901a\u8fc7\u7ec6\u80de\u819c\u63d0\u4f9b\u901a\u9053\u3002", "options": [{"letterSize": 1, "word": "all"}, {"letterSize": 4, "word": "proteins"}, {"letterSize": 3, "word": "soluble"}, {"letterSize": 2, "word": "many"}, {"letterSize": 3, "word": "enzymes"}, {"letterSize": 4, "word": "proteins"}, {"letterSize": 2, "word": "often"}, {"letterSize": 1, "word": "as"}, {"letterSize": 2, "word": "major"}, {"letterSize": 1, "word": "of"}, {"letterSize": 3, "word": "tissue"}, {"letterSize": 1, "word": "or"}, {"letterSize": 3, "word": "protein"}, {"letterSize": 1, "word": "of"}, {"letterSize": 1, "word": "and"}]}, "msg": "\u8bf7\u6c42\u6210\u529f\uff01"}
