What resources did you use that were helpful? How can you use what you learned in the future?", "answer": "Four months ago, I decided to study English again in a training centre because I intend to continue my studies overseas next year. I chose to take IELTS exam because it is one of the most recognized English language proficiency tests in the world. I felt really rusty at first. I spent the first weeks brushing-up on my vocabulary. My mother tongue influences me a lot when it comes to pronunciation. I listened to audio-recordings, watch English TV shows, and try to imitate the sounds I hear. Now I can carry on basic conversations. English is the language of international communication. Knowing English will absolutely increase my chance of getting a good job in a multinational company in the future. (120 \u5b57)"}, "msg": "\u8bf7\u6c42\u6210\u529f\uff01"}
