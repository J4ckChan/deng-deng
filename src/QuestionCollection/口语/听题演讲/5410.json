First of all, they all represent the literature from different dimensions. Different text types and different language styles are efficient in different communicating purposes. Poetry usually expresses the persona's emotions and is also a carrier of the poet's mindset. Fictions are like small versions of real-world societies, each protagonist has their characteristics and backgrounds and the fiction reflects the real-world context in some ways. Acknowledging places and their relevant histories would help to fill in the blanks of human civilizations' history. Secondly, different literature or text types help enrich human beings' psychological needs. People would need something far away from their personal lives as a dependent of triggering creativity.", "referenceText": "Do you think there is value in studying literature such as poetry, fiction or place?
