Describe some ways in which optimism could be beneficial to your health and other aspects of life.\"", "answer": "Personally speaking, I agree with the saying that an optimistic attitude can be good for people's health. People can perform better in the hope of achieving higher goals because optimism can serve as a strong motivation for people. Believing that a good thing will happen means that no worries will come to you, and thus one can be in a good mood, which will, in turn, contribute to better health. Optimism has the high power to heal and renew. It lightens people's burdens, inspires hope, connects people to others, and keeps people grounded, focused, and alert. It also helps people release anger and forgive sooner. \uff08104 \u5b57\uff09", "difficulty": 3, "difficultyName": "\u96be\uff08120\u4ee5\u4e0a\uff09"}, "msg": "\u8bf7\u6c42\u6210\u529f\uff01"}
