I personally don't agree with this. Because some people derive pleasure from feeding birds and other wildlife, however, this can be seriously harmful to their health and lead to other problems. You may think that feeding a few birds is providing sustenance and care, but there are many reasons, as explained below, that this is not the case. There is no regulation or law that prohibits the feeding of birds or other wildlife on private property. However, if you reside in a unit block there are often strata by-laws that prohibit this. The feeding of birds or other wildlife on public land such as parks, footpaths, nature strips, etc. is not permitted, as Council deems this to be a form of littering, even if the food is being fully consumed by the birds/wildlife shortly after being placed in the public space.
