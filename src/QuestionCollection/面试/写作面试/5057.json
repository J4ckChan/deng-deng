Why do you think people who do this job are not paid enough? How would you justify increasing their salaries?", "answer": "Social workers are those I believe are underpaid. They always consist of kind hearts and devoting personalities. Sometimes they need to go to a low-dense urban area to live to provide professional help to fragile. And usually, low-dense urban areas are not as convenient as dense population areas. Moreover, helping fragile is always considered the most laborious job. Disabilities and the elderly need social workers as dependencies to complete daily surviving tasks. They are providing the most urgent people's livelihood help but they are getting the lowest level of income. A nursing home is extremely expensive and social workers provide even more help than nursing homes. So, social workers deserve an increment on their salaries and entitlements.
