Explain your reasoning. ", "answer": "From my standpoint, it is vital for people to have their own hobbies. Jobs do not necessarily bring happiness to people like a lot of people are only doing their job for living. However, hobbies form the spiritual part of human life. People have enthusiasms about their actual hobbies and would like to put essence in them actively. They can use their hobbies to balance their work pace and to release their stress. So, it is definitely not enough to have a job only, but hobbies are also an irreplaceable component."}, "msg": "\u8bf7\u6c42\u6210\u529f\uff01"}
