What makes this room enjoyable? What do you like to do in this room, and who you enjoy being there with?", "answer": "My favorite room in my house is the living room. I have a television, a couch, a dining table and 2 chairs in my living room. You might be curious about if this is everything and if there is any other furniture. My answer would be no, there is no other furniture in the room. In fact, I really appreciate that I only have minimal things in my living room. Being a minimalist, I try to keep as few things as possible at home. This makes me comfortable. Some people might be concerned that this minimal lifestyle might have some negative impacts on my social life. However, most of my friends do not mind when they visit my place. When I have a party in my living room, some of the visitors could sit on the couch and other guests would sit on the floor. My empty living room leaves out a spacious area for people to simply just move around and hang out.  All my friends enjoyed the set up of my living room."}, "msg": "\u8bf7\u6c42\u6210\u529f\uff01"}
