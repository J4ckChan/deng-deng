Provide reasons to support your opinion.", "answer": "The controversial issue in respect of the role of social media, in today's society, has drawn huge public attention and sparked a heated debate. Some people hold the view that social media has the potential to impede people's progress. While there are certainly valid viewpoints, on the contrary, I personally believe that social media is more likely to help a person's chances of achieving goals. With the advancement in internet-related technology, there is no doubt that our society has entered the era of social media. That is to say, social media now predominates over any other ways of people acquiring information. Therefore, social media can help propagate the information rather quickly, and the higher exposure it gets, the greater the influence will be. For instance, when a person wants to encourage people to protect the environment, he or she will stand up in front of a camera and shoot a video that later will be posted onto the social media. By doing so, a large audience will be able to see the message that a person wants to convey. And if the message is convincing and justifiable enough, viewers will put it into action, which will greatly aid the process. (200 words)"}, "msg": "\u8bf7\u6c42\u6210\u529f\uff01"}
