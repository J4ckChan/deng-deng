Explain your reasoning.", "answer": "From my perspective, people are more motivated by the fear of failure rather than the desire to succeed. The first reason for my argument is that people only need to meet the minimum standard if their goal is not failing, therefore, they need fewer efforts and it is easier to start. But it requires more efforts to succeed, which is more likely to frighten people to give up. Specifically, most students study to pass the exam but only small a proportion of them are willing to spend more time to get a high distinction. Moreover, when facing the possibility of failure, people start to worry about the significant loss after failure. By contrast, the results of not successful are not serious compared to that of failure. In conclusion, it is reasonable to believe that people tend to be motived by the fear of failure due to fewer efforts needed, and serious results failure caused.
