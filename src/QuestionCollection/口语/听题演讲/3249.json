In terms of study, I normally download the learning materials to my computer and take notes on the touchable screen by using a pen. Moreover, I can also record the lecture and draw my own thinking map, which improves my efficiency in the study significantly. Most of the assignments I submitted during university study are digital versions and some tests are turned to computer-based, so I also need a computer to write assignments and complete online tests. Especially in these times, every day I need to turn on my laptop to have a video chat with tutors or classmates. When it comes to entertainment, the computer enables me to browse web pages, play games, and shop online with the help of the Internet. Even combined with virtual reality, computer games can offer players various experiences without physically being there.
