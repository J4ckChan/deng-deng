The connection between past, present, and future can allow people to remember and apply history to their daily lives. Seeing the government officials and local leaders actively participating in ceremonies will set an example for patriotism. And doing projects in memory of those major events will help citizens develop a society that is conscious of what is at stake when some do not respect the rights of others to exist. The truth is that in order to ensure that history has a continual impact on people's actions and decision-making processes, people can never allow the past to be laid to rest.
