Explain how you can live successfully within a culture different from your own.", "answer": "As one of the world's most ancient civilizations, China is rich in traditions and unique customs. One of the most influential cultures in China is to give a red envelope to children in Chinese Yew year. No matter what region or background their families are from, they normally receive red envelopes (lucky money). It usually consists of brand new bills put in a red envelope and given by the family's elders. It represents blessings for the year to come. People tend to stop receiving \"hongbao\" when they begin to work. Moving to a new culture can be quite an adventure. Whether you relocate for school, work, family, or just for a new experience, getting used to your new home can take time. Instead of wondering if you said something correctly or if you understand a situation properly, just ask. Permitting yourself to make mistakes is also vital. Try to find humour in situations and realize that we all will make mistakes, both yourself and others. It is part of the human experience! \uff08172 \u5b57\uff09"}, "msg": "\u8bf7\u6c42\u6210\u529f\uff01"}
