Provide reasons to support your opinion.", "answer": "Homework is important because it develops core skills in young children that will serve them throughout school and working life. Improved grades, discipline, time management, using resources, and improving communication are all vital life skills that will open the door to unique opportunities and help children find success in their careers. Repeating a task multiple times can feel arduous, but it\u2019s necessary to help increase children\u2019s skills and understanding of a subject. Regular homework will make certain concepts easier to understand and put them in an advantageous position should they seek a vocational career. Homework goes beyond just the task itself; it helps children take control of their workload and increase their time management skills. Homework is set with a deadline and taking ownership of this deadline helps them think independently and develop problem-solving skills. Hence homework is a crucial part of education."}, "msg": "\u8bf7\u6c42\u6210\u529f\uff01"}
