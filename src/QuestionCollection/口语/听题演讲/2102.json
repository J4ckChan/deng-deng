First of all, without privatization, public services can be made cheaper and better due to the constantly fierce competition. Privatization means that the control of service delivery will shift to the private sector. In theory, privatization approaches are based on the premise that the private sector can deliver goods and services more effectively and efficiently than the public sector. However, such move will give the private sector the power of monopoly. The public sector has other values besides efficiency that a private sector organization may not have, including effectiveness, responsiveness, and trust, which may not be the core value of the private sector, and hence quality delivery of services cannot be assured. What's more, privatization may facilitate financial exploitation. If privatized, the service owner would inevitably lose the commitment in pursuing better quality, whilst it could increase the prices of their service which customers would have to pay for, as there would not be any other options. Therefore, the public would be put at a disadvantage, which violates the original intention of serving the public good. In conclusion, I am convinced that services like healthcare and public transport should not be privatized.\uff08224 \u5b57\uff09", "referenceText": "Some people believe services like healthcare and public transportation should be privatized.
