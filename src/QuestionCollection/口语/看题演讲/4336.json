The most popular dishes served in the restaurant are pan-fried dumplings with seasonal filling, beef with Hangzhou peppers, Chongqing spicy chicken, and braised pork belly. The restaurant is my favorite for some reason. Firstly, I very much love the food served here. Secondly, the environment is brilliant - busy but not too noisy. The most important thing is that the staff are friendly and well-trained. Whenever a dish is served, one of the waitresses will introduce the name, ingredients, and cooking method of it. I go there pretty much twice a month.
