Why was that activity enjoyable or helpful to you? What would have made that activity better?", "answer": "I had never tried skiing before because I was too scared to do so, but I did it anyway last weekend. After finishing the skiing class, my friends took me to a relatively easy route, and it went smoothly. This gave me the illusion that I had already mastered the skill of skiing. However, when we took the tougher route, suddenly, everything changed. I fell over and over again. Fortunately, the ground was covered over with thick snow, so it didn't hurt much. But still, it could be dangerous if not handled well. Therefore, I was then taught how to turn while keeping going. After that, we went around and around on the harder track, and we all had great fun. If there weren't so many people, we wouldn't be stuck in the traffic jam, which would give us a lot more time to enjoy skiing. (146\u5b57)"}, "msg": "\u8bf7\u6c42\u6210\u529f\uff01"}
