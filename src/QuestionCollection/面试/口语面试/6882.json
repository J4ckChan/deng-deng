This ensures that your purchases (e.g., clothes, home goods, cosmetics, shampoo) are from companies that, for instance, pay their workers fairly, are kind to animals, and do not hurt the environment. Do you agree or disagree with this perspective? Use your knowledge and personal experience to support your opinion.", "answer": "I totally agree with this idea that each customer can make a difference in the world when they make their shopping decisions because they can decide not to buy products from companies that pay their workers fairly, are kind to animals, and do not hurt the environment. To stop buying products from these companies, they push the companies to right their wrongdoings. The force is unignorable for these companies because every consumer is a part of the market where companies can make a profit and the priority of a company is to make a profit. Therefore, it is vital for this idea to spread around and raise awareness of what everyone can do to help make a better world."}, "msg": "\u8bf7\u6c42\u6210\u529f\uff01"}
