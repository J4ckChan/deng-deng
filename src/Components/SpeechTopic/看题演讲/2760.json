Employees travel longer and longer to get to their workplace, and they have to cover long distances. The national average commute time in China is over 30 minutes. That means as a whole, the daily average Chinese commute time is about an hour, assuming one round trip. The longer your commute, the less time you have for family, friends, exercise, and nutrition\u2014and it's awful for your mental state. A recent study found that people with long commutes are 33 percent more likely to suffer from depression, 12 percent more likely to report work-related stress, and 46 percent get less than seven hours of sleep each night. In the future, commuting methods and the commute itself will begin to shift as transportation alternatives evolve, and the increasing prevalence of flexible work continues to provide alternatives. The commute itself will become more flexible and personalized, faster, more environmentally friendly, and less dependent on single-occupant cars.
