Who did you eat with, and was it an enjoyable experience? Would you recommend this restaurant to others?", "answer": "The last time I ate a meal at a restaurant was last week. I had a get-together with some of my high school friends whom I had not met since we graduated. Then, we decided to have dinner at a well-known pizza restaurant in the city centre. We talked with each other while waiting for the dishes. Some of my friends were studying at the same university, some had decided to get a job. And I was especially impressed by the decision of one friend to take a gap year. She said that as she had a strong passion for traveling, she would spend one year visiting lots of places. After a while, the dishes were served. The pizza was amazingly delicious, and the drinks were tasty although they were a bit expensive. I would definitely recommend this restaurant to others. And the whole experience was quite enjoyable."}, "msg": "\u8bf7\u6c42\u6210\u529f\uff01"}
