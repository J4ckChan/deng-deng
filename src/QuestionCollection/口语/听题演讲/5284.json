The main reason is that this type of area enables me to meet new people and make friends more easily. For example, after I moved to a very popular city, I met so many people and gained so many experiences just by talking to them. However, this was not the case when I used to live in a rural area. There were not many people that I could find to talk to or just to have a cup of coffee with. Therefore, I would prefer to live in a densely populated area so that I can broaden my social circle and never get bored.
