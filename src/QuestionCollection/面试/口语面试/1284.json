What would be the most difficult things to live without? How would people's lives change?", "answer": "Firstly, I have to say it is a globalized world. There is almost nothing that is purely produced in my country, and if there is, the demands will not be met by the supply. For example, the computer we can use can be produced by a local factory, but some of the computer components have to be bought from other countries. Therefore, this computer is not purely produced in my country. So the topic that I can only buy products made in my country is not possible. If it really happens, then there will surely be an economic recession, and people will lose their jobs. The development and modernization will stagnate, and people will die due to a lack of medicine. The most difficult thing to live without is medicine because most of the highly effective medicine is imported. Without these medicines, people will die. If globalization is reversed, China will go back to at least 30 years ago when people have to focus on agriculture and manufacturing machines that are needed to ensure our basic needs.
