Founded about 60 years ago, it is an international non-governmental organization dedicated to wilderness preservation and the reduction of human impact on the environment. Even in China, I can feel the strong influence of this organization. When I visited the natural preservation of panda in Sichuan, there are pictures presenting how the Worldwide Fund for Nature raise funds and send volunteers to help protect the endangered pandas. It is so inspiring to see so many participants coming from different countries contribute to one aim for saving the animal and the earth we are living on together.
