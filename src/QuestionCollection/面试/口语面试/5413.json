How does this activity open your imagination? What can your friends learn from you to improve their creativity?", "answer": "I feel creative when I am doing visual design. Visual design can be applied to anywhere in our lives including logo design, furniture design, tattoo design, poster design, and origami design. I usually have so many essence and ideas when doing visual design and I feel so creative. It is just about thinking of random stuff and using the elements from random stuff as an inspiration to create a totally different thing. Visual design is actually helping me to build a customary non-regulated way of thinking, and my friends learnt this mindset from me and found it so useful in solving problems in reality."}, "msg": "\u8bf7\u6c42\u6210\u529f\uff01"}
