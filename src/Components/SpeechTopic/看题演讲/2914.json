I had chosen a university far away from my hometown, which made it difficult for me to spend any time with my parents. Especially the older they are getting, the more regret I become. If I could go back to the time when choosing a university, I will choose the one near my hometown. A close family ensures everyone feels loved, supported, and strong. So, whatever life throws your way, you'll always be able to overcome it with the strength of the family unit. As one of the famous experts says, \"At the end of your life, you will never regret not having passed one more test, not winning one more verdict, or not closing one more deal. You will regret time not spent with a husband, a friend, a child, a parent.\"\uff08161 \u5b57\uff09", "options": [{"content": "What was your decision?"}, {"content": "What do you wish you had done differently?"}], "difficulty": 2, "difficultyName": "\u4e00\u822c\uff08105~115\uff09"}, "msg": "\u8bf7\u6c42\u6210\u529f\uff01"}
