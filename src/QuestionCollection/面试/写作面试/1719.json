Provide reasons to support your opinion.", "answer": "In my opinion, dressing beautifully is of great importance in people's daily life. First of all, to have a decent outlook shows one person's respect toward others. Secondly, when people are dressing nicely, they tend to feel more confident, especially in a formal event. Besides, dressing well helps both the person himself and the people around him feel happier, and a great mood will, in turn, facilitate the efficiency of work and contribute to forging the bond between people.\uff0879 \u5b57\uff09"}, "msg": "\u8bf7\u6c42\u6210\u529f\uff01"}
