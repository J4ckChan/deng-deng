Explain your choice.", "answer": "In the case of a house fire, the one possession I would try to rescue first would be my laptop. Out of all the possessions, I consider my laptop the most valuable one. First of all, my laptop is obviously the most expensive item. It is not only because of the monetary value of the laptop that I choose to rescue it first but also because of the precious memory I attached to it. The laptop was a gift from my father on the day I went overseas to further my study. I have weighed up the cost of replacing it over everything else. For many of us, our one item to rescue from the flames is of sentimental value, something priceless that can't be replaced should tragedy befall it. For everything else, we know there's home insurance, which can save us plenty of heartaches when it comes to picking up the pieces and moving on after something breaks or our home is damaged. I wish to keep memories of experiences and what I consider lifetime achievements. However, it's not just sentimentality that comes into play. The prospect of losing productivity and missing out on work is something I would fear, so the first item to grab would be my laptop. I would grab my laptop so that work wouldn\u2019t be disrupted. My laptop is my extra limb. I use it every day, and there are also several essential documents stored in it.\uff08245 \u5b57\uff09"}, "msg": "\u8bf7\u6c42\u6210\u529f\uff01"}
