What makes this room enjoyable? What do you like to do in this room, and who you enjoy being there with?", "answer": "For the question to describe a favorite room in your house, the answer can be various depend on different people. For me, the living room would be my favorite spot. I live in a newly built apartment building on the second floor with a large covered balcony overlooking a tree-lined parking lot. My record player sits atop an antique credenza, Nat King Cole bellowing forth into a sunlit room. A huge, favored original charcoal portrait leans against the wall, which I brought from an art gallery. A stately pair of tuxedo chairs, chosen in lieu of a couch, provide seating. There are books throughout the room used as much for decoration as for reading. I like to sit by the window, have a book to read and enjoy the beautiful sunshine coming from the full-height glass windows. I love being surrounded by the things that bring me joy, but moreover, I enjoy the opportunity to share my home with friends and family. A cup of fresh coffee and a sweet pastry served on vintage dessert plates is always on offer here for them.\uff08183 \u5b57\uff09"}, "msg": "\u8bf7\u6c42\u6210\u529f\uff01"}
