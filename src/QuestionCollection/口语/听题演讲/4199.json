I predict that the future of education will require educators to be more entrepreneurial, collaborative, creative, and innovative. Additionally, learners will be even more tech-savvy, demanding, confident, and focused as consumers of education. In addition to having more project-based instructional models, major changes will take place in the core curriculum. Contrary to the old-school traditions housed in English, math, social studies, and science, curricula in twenty years will reflect the skills mandated by emerging economies and technologies. Skills such as coding, design, sustainability, and financial literacy will have to be integrated and taught into classroom curricula.
