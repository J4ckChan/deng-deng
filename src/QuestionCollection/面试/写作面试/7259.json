Why did you decide to try it, and how was the experience?", "answer": "The most unusual food that I have ever eaten is risotto. I would say it because it is made from rice, but in totally different ways compared with Chinese dishes. I found it strange and the only reason why I decided to try it is that I read the history of rice in Italy before. Rice has been grown in southern Italy since at least the 14th century. From the south, rice gradually made its way north toward northern Italy, where the marshes of the Po river valley were suitable for rice cultivation. According to a legend, a young glassblower's apprentice of the Fabbrica del Duomo di Milano from Flanders, who used to use saffron as a pigment, added it to a rice dish at a wedding feast. The first recipe identifiable as risotto dates from 1809. It includes rice saut\u00e9ed in butter, sausages, bone marrow and onions with broth with saffron gradually added. There is a recipe for a dish named risotto in the 1854 Trattato di Cucina by Giovanni Vilardi, assistant chief chef to kings. However, the question of who invented the risotto in Milan remains unanswered today. \uff08190\uff09"}, "msg": "\u8bf7\u6c42\u6210\u529f\uff01"}
