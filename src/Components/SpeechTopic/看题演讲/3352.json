I invited my close friends to play in a newly opened park. At the end of our play, my friends asked me to take the roller coaster with them, saying I have to challenge myself to celebrate that memorable day. I have hesitated for a while and finally summoned up the courage to ride with them. And I even found I did enjoy the speed and excitement. If I could go back to that time, I would still make the same decision. After that ride, I realized that some challenges are not as horrible as I thought, I cannot always avoid doing them. Instead of telling myself, I cannot do it, why would not try to do it first? With more courage, I can conquer the fear and they will bring unexpected surprises to me.
