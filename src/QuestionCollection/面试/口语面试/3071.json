Who taught you this behavior, and how have they modeled it for you? Why do you think it is important?", "answer": "Organized, well-structured youth sports and on-going physical activities can provide many benefits for people. The most important thing I do to stay healthy is to exercise on a regular basis. My father taught me this behaviour and helped tailor an exercise plan for me to stick with. Basically, I have to be physically active for 30 minutes most days of the week. I break this up into three 10-minute sessions when pressed for time. Healthy movement may include walking, jogging, stretching or other activities I enjoy and feel like to perform in different cases. Exercise is important because it can help me reach my fitness goals and maintain a healthy weight. However, it also encourages healthy decision-making such as not smoking and not drinking. Sports also have hidden health benefits such as lowering the chance of a number of diseases. (140\u5b57)"}, "msg": "\u8bf7\u6c42\u6210\u529f\uff01"}
