This project was about studying the learning results of international students at my university and I mainly used a quantitative research method to get the result. To be specific, I had gotten the exam result from 100 different undergraduates from different countries at my university and worked really hard to get the findings. Finally, I found that there was no relationship between nationalities and learning results, but I needed to say that my sample was very small and only found students within my own university. Thus, there were still some possibilities that were worth to be explored in the field. All in all, I completed my research project about learning results and international students and got my findings successfully.", "options": [{"content": "What was the project for?"}, {"content": "What was the result?"}], "difficulty": 3, "difficultyName": "\u96be\uff08120\u4ee5\u4e0a\uff09"}, "msg": "\u8bf7\u6c42\u6210\u529f\uff01"}
