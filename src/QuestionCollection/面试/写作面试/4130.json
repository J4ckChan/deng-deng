What do you like most about the genre? What is your favorite story in this genre, and what makes this story interesting?", "answer": "When it comes to my favourite genre of film, the first thing that springs to my mind is the action movie. It is the fighting scenes that I like most about the genre. I have always dreamed of learning Kung Fu and fight some bad guys to preserve justice. And my favourite story in this genre is Shanghai Noon by Jackie Chan, who is one of the greatest action movie stars worldwide. The story is about a Chinese man who travels to the western world to rescue a kidnapped princess. What is interesting is that he dramatically teams up with a train robber, together they take down a Chinese traitor and his corrupt boss. Jackie Chan is highly renowned for his action comedy films across the globe, and I like every film of his. (134\u5b57)"}, "msg": "\u8bf7\u6c42\u6210\u529f\uff01"}
