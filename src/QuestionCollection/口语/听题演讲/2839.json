Every student's situation is unique, but there are a few problems that almost all university students deal with at least once during school. The first challenge is the study pressure. University is academically challenging. For many, university courses require much more effort than high school classes. Unlike most high schools, universities often pack two years of content into one year. At times, it seems impossible to stay on top of it all. The second obstacle should be money. Tuition costs are rising at alarmingly high rates. Add to that the cost of meals, supplies, transportation, and textbooks, so you will have a university student's worst nightmare. There are a lot of university students who drop out of school every year because they cannot afford the price. Others are forced to juggle full academic schedules with full-time jobs to make ends meet. It is becoming increasingly difficult for students to graduate debt-free.
