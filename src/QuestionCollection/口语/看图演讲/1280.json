On the right side of the picture, the two elderly women talk with each other, and they are dressing casually; one of them is talking with her body leaning forward, while the other is listening patiently. The rest of the picture is about the store, and it may be a small gallery that sells framed paintings, including portraitures and landscape paintings. This reminds me of my own experience of visiting a small gallery with my family, which is full of different kinds of interesting paintings that drew about realistic landscapes or modern buildings, and it also has abstract paintings that are difficult to grasp the idea. We spent a lot of time in that store and paid our attention to seeing every detail of the paintings, and more importantly, we bought our favorite painting at last! In conclusion, this picture is really interesting and helps me get a better understanding of my paintings, and reminds me of a lovely memory.
