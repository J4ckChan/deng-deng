Overdevelopment for tourism has the same problems as other coastal developments but often has a greater impact as the tourist developments are located at or near fragile marine ecosystems. As a result, developers should try not to develop areas such as coastlines and jungles. Massive influxes of tourists, often to a relatively small area, have a huge impact. They add to the pollution, waste, and water needs of the local population, putting local infrastructure and habitats under enormous pressure. For example, 85% of the 1.8 million people who visit Australia's Great Barrier Reef are concentrated in two small areas, Cairns and the Whitsunday Islands, which together have a human population of just 130,000 or so. In conclusion, to reduce the adverse effects on the environment, one of the easiest and most effective ways is to preserve the places where wild animals live and stop developing new coastline and jungle areas.
