What types of preparation do you do to show that you are a good fit for the job?\"", "answer": "An easy way to start this process is simply by doing a search on the organization and trying to relate your previous work experience to the specific duties of the job opportunity available. Don\u2019t stop there though, you can also click on the news tab after you search your potential employer to see if they have appeared in media outlets recently, giving you access to some topical news that might be useful to mention in the interview to demonstrate you have taken a deeper level of interest into the business. It doesn\u2019t hurt to do some research on the industry as a whole as well, to see if there have been any recent developments or trends that may be affecting the sector and could directly have an impact on the position you\u2019re interviewing for. It\u2019s also another piece of information that can be brought up in the conversation to demonstrate your desire to understand the industry. Don\u2019t forget to find out as much as possible about the role itself before the interview. Finally, research the hiring manager, as well as anyone else who might be attending the interview, on social media to better understand their working history and professional interests. However, we\u2019d recommend sending any connection requests after the interview happens.
