It is the most important archaeological site on the island of Aegina and in fact one of the most important in all of Greece. The Temple sits on top of a mountain above the resort town of Agia Marina. And it dates back to around 500 BC. In Greek mythology, Aphaia was a Greek goddess, the daughter of Zeus, who was worshipped exclusively at this sanctuary. From what I can see from the picture, the Temple is primarily built of limestone and is in ivory color. It is built on a level foundation, and there are numerous huge columns and beams. Despite the fact that it is merely wreckage, it still gives me a great sense of magnificence.
