The first films were made in 1894 by Thomas Edison in New Jersey. The first public exhibition of his films was in 1895 in New York City. Later that year, filmed presentations were shown in London and Paris. Between then and the 1920s, as more and more films were made, a variety of camera types emerged. A film camera is a machine that records pictures, sounds and motion on a strip of film. At first, the film was projected through the camera viewfinder to be recorded, but it was soon found easier to record on the film during shooting with a device called an optical printer.
