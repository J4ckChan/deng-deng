How did you do it and what character qualities did you display?", "answer": "I have a very torture period at the start of high school. It was the time when I first came to Australia and joined a local school community. I could not speak proper English and had communication barriers when talking to people. I believed that learning and practicing would always be the most practical way to be proficient at a particular skill. So, I listened to podcasts and read news articles every morning, and tried to repeat the content from the podcasts and news articles. Gradually, English started to be simpler and now it becomes one of my strengths. Hence, I think persistence is the most important quality to overcome a challenge.
