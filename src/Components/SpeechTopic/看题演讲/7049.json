One of the first projects that I managed had a very tight deadline. I accepted it to impress my boss. Unfortunately, I wasn\u2019t able to get the project finished on time. After that, I sought help and studied various strategies to prevent delays. I learned to keep track of the project schedule from day one, identify potential problems and act quickly, and keep open communication with the team, to name a few. That failure helped me become a better project manager.", "options": [{"content": "What were you trying to do?"}, {"content": "Why were you unsuccessful?"}, {"content": "How did you feel afterward?"}], "difficulty": 2, "difficultyName": "\u4e00\u822c\uff08105~115\uff09"}, "msg": "\u8bf7\u6c42\u6210\u529f\uff01"}
