My mom is a doctor and she must try her best to cure patients without making any mistakes. Although some patients may not be cured, my mother needs to make sure that she always tries her best. This is a job that cannot tolerate any errors, so I think that this is an occupation that is especially stressful. Besides, being a tutor or professor at the university is also stressful for the following reasons. Firstly, you need to teach some latest knowledge to students and make sure that they can understand the knowledge. Secondly, you also have the requirement to publish several papers, which is indeed difficult. All in all, I believe that being a doctor or a teacher is especially stressful in today's society.", "referenceText": "What are some jobs that you think are especially stressful?", "referenceTranslate": "\u4f60\u8ba4\u4e3a\u54ea\u4e9b\u5de5\u4f5c\u538b\u529b\u7279\u522b\u5927?", "difficulty": 2, "difficultyName": "\u4e00\u822c\uff08105~115\uff09"}, "msg": "\u8bf7\u6c42\u6210\u529f\uff01"}
