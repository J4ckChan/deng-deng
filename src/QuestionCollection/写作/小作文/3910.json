What do you recommend? Why? Give specific reasons for your recommendation.\"", "answer": "I would definitely recommend the company to contribute funds to an organization that promotes environmental protection. First of all, sustainability has been a historically persistent topic, and everyone on the planet should assume the responsibility of protecting the environment in which we live. This investment may not necessarily be profitable any time soon, but it will surely be beneficial, both to the company and the earth, in the long run. Secondly, this investment is for the sake of future generations. Without an enjoyable environment to live in, no arts will be appreciated. In this sense, investment in environmental protection is of greater value than that in arts.
