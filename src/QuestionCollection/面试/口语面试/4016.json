What stuck with you about these events? Why do you think the story was news-worthy?", "answer": "I remember hearing about a news story last week which is kind of funny. A man in France has accidentally blown up part of his house while trying to chase a fly with an electric swat. A reaction occurred between the swat and the leaking gas at his home, causing an explosion and part of his kitchen to blow up. The blast also damaged a section of his roof and the house is currently uninhabitable. Somehow the man managed to escape the catastrophe with just a burn to his hand. As to why this story was news-worthy, I suppose it was because no such thing had ever happened before - a coincidentally weird but highly dangerous incident resulted from an ordinary, daily practice with a surprising ending. And this is what stuck with me about the incidence. (137\u5b57)"}, "msg": "\u8bf7\u6c42\u6210\u529f\uff01"}
