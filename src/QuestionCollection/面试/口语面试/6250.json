Which ones do you think you will have more time to enjoy in the next year? Suggest ways that these hobbies could change in the next five years.", "answer": "Okay, I am going to talk about hobbies that I have. I like swimming, yoga and listening to music. I will spend more time on yoga next year. Because this is a sport that can really let me relax and enjoy the present. The pressure of work and study in the past year was very high. It was yoga that helped me make more friends and passed the most difficult time. Thus, I will continue to insist in the new year. The development prospect of this sport is also bright. In the next five years, I believe that a considerable number of people will learn about yoga and stick to it. Both young and middle-aged people are very suitable for this non-competitive sport. It is likely that this sport will also be popularized in primary and secondary schools and become one of the optional courses of student sports."}, "msg": "\u8bf7\u6c42\u6210\u529f\uff01"}
