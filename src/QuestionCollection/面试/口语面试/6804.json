Communication is one of the most important interpersonal skills that help effectively and efficiently in teamwork. Verbal communication skills allow me to express my perceptions and my perspectives so that it eliminates barriers between my understanding and my co-workers' understanding of the same thing. Written communication skills allow me to express accurate and detailed analyses in a professional but easier-to-be-understood way. Hence, my results could be presented to different groups of colleagues and even customers who do not have any knowledge in my professional area."}, "msg": "\u8bf7\u6c42\u6210\u529f\uff01"}
