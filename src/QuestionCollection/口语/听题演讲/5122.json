It was in the year 1564 when William Shakespeare was born. Over 1,000 words in the English language are used today because of William Shakespeare, and phrases from his plays are still commonly used in daily conversation. It is not just his language that was important, he was the great entertainer of his day, writing in a time when the theatre was popular entertainment for all people. Elizabeth I have been the queen for much of his life, but it was Shakespeare who wrote much of the history.", "referenceText": "Describe an important historical event.
