From this picture, we can assume that it is a competitive sport called archery. In the middle of the picture, the two athletes are holding the bows and arrows very tightly, and they are both wearing traditional Japanese-style clothes that are in the colors of red, blue, and black. In the background of the picture, there is a big crowd of people who are looking at the right-hand side nervously, and maybe they are waiting to see the results. At the bottom of the picture, there are three people wearing yellow coats who are also looking at the right-hand side with attention, and maybe they are judges to make sure the results are announced correctly. In conclusion, this picture is really interesting and helps me to get a better understanding of archery.
