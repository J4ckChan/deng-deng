And teamwork often leads to higher productivity as there is most often an equal division of labor. So instead of having to look into all the aspects of a project individually, each person merely has to deal with one aspect of it. Smaller tasks will require less time and effort. On the other hand, while working in a team, conflicts might occur. And a series of meetings need to be scheduled to work collaboratively. But in cases where group dynamics are not handled properly, it can result in loss of time and decrease the efficiency of the team. Nonetheless, I enjoy working on a team more than individually.
