The airport is the place where foreign visitors first set their foot and have interaction with the country. Therefore, it is of critical importance to build decent airports in capital cities that make travelers feel they are welcome. To be more specific, brochures introducing the country to foreigners, containing the most relevant information they might need during their visit, and printed in different languages should be readily available at the airport. From the brochures, they can get a good idea of where to pay a visit and how to make their stay a pleasant one. Apart from that, it is highly recommended that citizens show kindness to any foreign visitors who come to them and ask a favor. This can range from asking the way to their destinations to asking you to take a photo of them.
