Explain what is important about that time period to you.", "answer": "If I could travel to the past and I could choose the time and location, I would like to go back to the age of 18. Because back then I made a very stupid decision, and I really hope to have a second chance to change that decision. During that time period, I was in a very difficult situation to choose either to go to college or to get a job. In the end, I decided to quit high school before graduation and started to work in a cafe. If I could choose again, I would definitely continue my education instead of getting a low-skilled job. If I could have graduated from high school, my life might have turned out in a completely different way. "}, "msg": "\u8bf7\u6c42\u6210\u529f\uff01"}
