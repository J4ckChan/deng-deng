Why do you think this invention has been helpful? Is there a way this invention could be improved?", "answer": "The invention of the internet is very helpful. With the internet, people can perceive information and news across the world wirelessly and can contact family and friends from a long distance. This invention has brought so much convenience for human beings, and one thing that can be improved is to get more convenient access to the internet. In 2022, the majority of the internet services are still based on the modem and the cables. To set up the internet, people would have to connect their address to the cables from a service-providing company and cannot access the internet everywhere with one service. Elon Musk is currently implementing a plan to achieve the goal of accessing the internet anywhere in the world with one service - Starlink, and now people can already choose Starlink services."}, "msg": "\u8bf7\u6c42\u6210\u529f\uff01"}
