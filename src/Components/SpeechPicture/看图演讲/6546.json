She wears a pair of blue gloves and goggles while paying attention to the tube in her left hand. She is dripping some chemical liquid into that tube. It seems like she is doing an experiment that involves multiple chemicals. It might be dangerous if she is not trained in doing such experiments. This reminds me of my high school experience. I was not familiar with the lab safety regulation and forgot to wear goggles. Fortunately, I did not get injured. But this experience taught me the importance of lab safety.", "photo": "https://cdn.51ddedu.com/images/576876784310558720.jpg", "difficulty": 2, "difficultyName": "\u4e00\u822c\uff08105~115\uff09"}, "msg": "\u8bf7\u6c42\u6210\u529f\uff01"}
