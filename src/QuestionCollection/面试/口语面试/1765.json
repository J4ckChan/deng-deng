How does this activity help you to calm down? Why should others try doing this activity when they need to relax?", "answer": "Relaxing can help us keep healthy in both our bodies and minds, helping us recover from the everyday stresses that lives throw at us. Whenever I want to get relaxed, I will try progressive muscle relaxation. This process involves tensing and relaxing each muscle group. Progressive muscle relaxation can reduce anxiety and muscle tension. If you have trouble falling asleep, this method may also help with your sleep problems. When you relax your muscles, your body gets the signal that it is okay to fall asleep. I strongly recommend that everyone should try this to relax and keep healthy.\uff0899 \u5b57\uff09"}, "msg": "\u8bf7\u6c42\u6210\u529f\uff01"}
