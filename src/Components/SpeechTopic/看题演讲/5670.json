Some people with solid financial conditions would choose to pay for a space travel to satisfy their curiosities about the universe, and that's how space travel becomes commercial. The benefits of space travel are obvious. People who are space travelers can have a very rare and unique experience to actually stay in the spacecraft, acknowledge how the machine operates, and experience different gravity. However, there might be risks associated. For example, there might be accidents during the process of launching or recycling a spacecraft. In addition, space travelers would experience extreme heat when entering the atmosphere. Also, if the entry angle is too big, the spacecraft would be bounced back to the universe and escape the earth at the escape velocity. If I was rich enough and could travel into space, I would definitely go because I am so addicted to everything about the universe. The experience is worth undertaking the risks.", "options": [{"content": "What might be beneficial about commercial space travel?"}, {"content": "What are the risks?"}, {"content": "If you could travel into space, where would you want to go?"}], "difficulty": 2, "difficultyName": "\u4e00\u822c\uff08105~115\uff09"}, "msg": "\u8bf7\u6c42\u6210\u529f\uff01"}
