Why do you think teenagers should be allowed to do this? Why do you think it's not legal?", "answer": "Personally speaking, teenagers should be taught how to manage their finances from an early age and having a bank account is an essential part of this education. Therefore, I reckon that teenagers should be allowed to open a bank account, which is not legally permitted before they turn 18. To begin with, it's good to see teenagers handle banking transactions and simple accounting of their money comfortably. It gives them great pride and sense of responsibility to check their passbooks, to understand what debit and credit is and how much their money had earned. Having opened a bank, teenagers can carry debit cards with them for paying for train and bus passes, for shopping, for paying for mobile recharge, for depositing pocket money etc. It is more convenient and safer than carrying cash. Parents can transfer fixed amounts to the teenager's accounts every month and the teens manage the cash themselves. The main reason why teenagers are not legally allowed to open a bank account before turning 18 is that they are generally not capable of managing finance on their own. Additionally, teenagers normally wouldn't have got any job from which they constantly get remuneration to be deposited. (198\u5b57)"}, "msg": "\u8bf7\u6c42\u6210\u529f\uff01"}
