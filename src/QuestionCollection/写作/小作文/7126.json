Why? Give specific reasons for your answer.\"", "answer": "If I have to make a complaint about a bad product or poor service, I will directly write an email to the firm because of the following reasons. Firstly, I am an introverted person who can hardly speak or communicate with others. Because of my personality, I always choose to write an email or leave a message rather than face-to-face communication. For example, last weekend, I bought a plate from an online store but unfortunately, it was broken. Thus, I chose to complain about this broken plate. After considering it for one hour, I wrote an email to the firm in order to complain about this broken plate and asked for a coupon. Secondly, writing an email is a very convenient way to communicate because they can immediately know the problem. All in all, if I must complain about one product or service, I will write an email to that company.
