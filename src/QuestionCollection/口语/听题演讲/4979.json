However, I am interested in prolonging my lifespan. Extending my lifespan by 10 years might help me gain more experience and enables me to have the opportunity to witness the development of civilization. Moreover, there might be other reasons why people want to extend their lifespan, such as having more time to enjoy life and spend time with families.
