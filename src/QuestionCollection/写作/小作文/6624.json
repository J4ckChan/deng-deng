Do you agree or disagree? Why? Give specific reasons for your answer.\"", "answer": "I agree with the statement that people should sometimes do things they do not enjoy doing. One reason why people should sometimes do things they do not enjoy doing is that the things they do not enjoy may be the only survival means during such moments. This means that failure to do them will cause a lot of suffering. For example, in most countries, employment opportunities are scarce while the number of qualified people who look for employment is high. As a result, people must spend some time without jobs once they leave college. In such situations, people may be looking for particular jobs but other jobs they do not like emerge before they get the jobs they dream of.", "difficulty": 2, "difficultyName": "\u4e00\u822c\uff08105~115\uff09"}, "msg": "\u8bf7\u6c42\u6210\u529f\uff01"}
