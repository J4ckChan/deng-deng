I on the contrary believe that there are many advantages of studying abroad. First, studying internationally can broaden your horizon. This means that you can learn a new language and in the meantime experience a different culture and lifestyle. With these experiences, you can be more open to different people and thoughts. Second, studying abroad can bring challenges that you would not encounter otherwise. These challenges can make you more independent and increase your problem-solving skills which are increasingly essential nowadays. Overall, various advantages of studying internationally should be taken into consideration when deciding which university you want to go to.", "referenceText": "What are some advantages of studying internationally?", "referenceTranslate": "\u51fa\u56fd\u7559\u5b66\u6709\u4ec0\u4e48\u597d\u5904?", "difficulty": 1, "difficultyName": "\u7b80\u5355\uff08100\u4ee5\u4e0b\uff09"}, "msg": "\u8bf7\u6c42\u6210\u529f\uff01"}
