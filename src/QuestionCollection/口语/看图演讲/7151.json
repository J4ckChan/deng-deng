They are all boys about six to eight years old and try their best to keep quiet. This picture also shows that they wear different kinds of casual clothes whose prices are hardly known. Besides, a teacher who stands in front of these children is giving a lesson and tries to use some gestures to attract the kids' attention. Compared with classes in schools, we can also see that this lesson happens in the forest which is far away from the city centre. Moreover, these trees are withered because there are only some branches without leaves, and the leaves are all lying on the ground; thus, we can probably guess that this situation happens in autumn. In my point of view, this teacher chooses this place intentionally because he or she is likely to teach something about nature and animals.
