What do the contents say about your life? What is one item you want to add to your closet in the next year and why?", "answer": "When you have a chance to take a glance at my closet, you would be amazed at how much content I already have put into it. For me, I just want a little reminder that I already have so much. I\u2019m so lucky, and my daily attitude should reflect that. If I want to go to the mall with a friend one night to shop for fun, that\u2019s OK, but I\u2019ll know that I don\u2019t need another pair of jeans no matter what they cost because I already have five! It might surprise you, but I\u2019m not that big of a shopper anyway. My thing is I want to make sure that I really wear everything I own, or I should be donating it. If I do buy something new, it should be something I really need. And the big goal is to be thankful for what I already have. If I were to add another item into my closet in the next year, I suppose I would get a nice-looking cap, probably a black one as I already got a white one in there. I would like a black cap because I really don\u2019t want to wash, blow-dry, and then style my hair on a daily basis. It takes a fair amount of time, and I am worried that those hair-styling products will somewhat damage my hair. I picked black because black goes with every other color. How lazy I am!
