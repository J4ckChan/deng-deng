Which person or restaurant makes your favorite version of this food? What is your favorite memory of eating it?", "answer": "When it comes to a food that reminds me of my home, the first thing that springs to my mind is fried noodles. It was 5 years ago that I went to high school overseas on my own. The school canteen offered merely western food, which did not suit my taste. It never occurred to me that I would be able to have Chinese fried noodles in a place so far away from home. I was so grateful that my teacher took me to the only Chinese restaurant downtown where the chef made my favourite version of fried noodles. It gave me a chance to experience the environment of home overseas. This is my favourite memory of eating it. (119\u5b57)"}, "msg": "\u8bf7\u6c42\u6210\u529f\uff01"}
