What made them so good at teaching? What is the most important thing you learned from him or her?", "answer": "The best teacher I have ever had was my English teacher back in Years 11 and 12. Her name is Mrs. R and she was a capable and devoted person. Love made her so good at teaching. When I first went to that high school, English was a big challenge for me. She volunteered to be my teacher and gave us extra classes on practical English skills. I still remember my first lesson with Mrs.R, I wrote about bubble tea. She polished my writings, corrected my pronunciations, and answered my questions whenever I had one. She treated me more than teachers and students. She celebrated all Chinese festivals with me and took me out for tasty pizzas. The most important thing I learned from her is being philanthropic. She loves volunteering and she had been teaching voluntarily in Thailand for three years, and that is where she met her husband. She has inspired me a lot, so I am planning to pursue her steps."}, "msg": "\u8bf7\u6c42\u6210\u529f\uff01"}
