The statement is contradictory. We may not like it, but it has to be faced.  The choices we make always affect someone. At times, a choice may primarily affect the person who makes it, but never exclusively. Every choice a person makes, large or small, from how time is spent to which career to pursue, will have an effect on another person. It could be a seemingly minuscule repercussion or one large enough to change everything. Regardless of the degree, someone is always affected by the choices of others. It is impossible to avoid. Because of this, decisions should not be handled with indifference toward the influence they could have on the lives of others. Rather they should be valued for this very reason."}, "msg": "\u8bf7\u6c42\u6210\u529f\uff01"}
