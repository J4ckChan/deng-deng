Explain the reasons for your opinion.", "answer": "I was raised in a culture where many things were deemed inappropriate for children to do, and the ban on dating is the one I disagree the most with. Although for the most part, I agree that high school students aren't in the best age to start dating because of possible distraction for a chance to change your future to be a better one. But I strongly disagree that it needs to be banned. High school students being teenagers and have experienced their fair share of life's issues, so they would have better judgemental abilities and do the right things even if they were to be dating. Students would have the self-discipline to not let dating affect their studies, and children can even learn a lesson from the relationship, such as how to take care of others etc. If the restriction was to be removed, my life during high school would probably be sweeter as I would have already tasted the fruit of love. Dating a gorgeous girl would have greatly relieved the heavy burden of study during those pedestrian school days, especially the bleakest final exam periods. If, by any chance, that was a healthy relationship that she and I have maintained all the way along till now, as I am mature enough now, we would probably have seen each other's families and planned to take the next step \u2013 marriage.
