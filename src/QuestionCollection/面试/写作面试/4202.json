Explain the reasons for your choice.", "answer": "I would like to know in the future whether AI is being integrated into our daily lives. After too many episodes of Black Mirror, The Terminator, and The Western World, I tend to fear that the future where technology is supposed to help us ends up hurting us more. Many movies and TV shows depict the future to be bleak and depressing with AI trying to ruin our lives. I hope to see the future as a place where lives are improved tremendously with the help of AI or technology. I want to know how we progress to that phase and what some of the mistakes that were made along the way. Furthermore, I wish to know if people ever get a chance to travel through time? Will people ever know if aliens exist? There are so many things that I wish I could learn about the future. All in all, I hope everything will turn out to be right for us.
