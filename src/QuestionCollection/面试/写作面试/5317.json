How did you decide what to buy them? What was their reaction when they received the gift, and how did the reaction make you feel?", "answer": "The last gift I bought for my best friend is a red bracelet with a piece of gold attached to it. It was a gift for her 21st birthday. I decided this gift is because she was born in Australia but she is still intrinsically Chinese. 21st birthday is the most important birthday in Australian culture, and I chose a piece of gold because it has a stable value all the time. I attached this piece of gold on a red bracelet is because red is a Chinese traditional colour and represents fortune. So, this gift carries my wish. I am hoping for her to be happy and lucky all the time. She was so happy when getting this gift and it made me soothed. "}, "msg": "\u8bf7\u6c42\u6210\u529f\uff01"}
