How have you gotten better at this activity over time? Who do you enjoy doing this activity with, and how has it impacted your relationship?", "answer": "One activity that I do for fun is doing body surfing. I used to go to the beach every day in the summertime to practice my surfing skill and that\u2019s how I got better at surfing. Although I would appreciate some company, most of the time I just went there by myself. Occasionally, my friends would join me and do surfing with me. But many of them do not prefer to go to a beach that is over crowed. They tend to go to less popular areas, such as Clovelly or Coogee, while I am, on the other hand, a true fan of Bondi beach. I just could not get enough of it. I love its vibe and I do not mind the crowd there. Therefore, the more times I went the better surfing skills I gained. In terms of relationships, if I have to be honest, I have to admit that my great surfing skill was one of the reasons why I got so popular among guys."}, "msg": "\u8bf7\u6c42\u6210\u529f\uff01"}
