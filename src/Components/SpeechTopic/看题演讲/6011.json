People need money for daily groceries and necessities, but apart from those spending, there is still money left. Then how to allocate money wisely is something people pursue. Savings can help hedge the risks when there is an urgent need for a cash flow, so taking some money as savings is very important to be risk-averse. Making investments is to be speculative, gambling for a higher return with a limited principal. This is to embrace the risks rationally to get an extra income. People often waste money on alcohol, drugs, and luxury brands. Apart from the three money-wasting sources with passive effects, all spendings bring a sense of happiness, so those cannot be defined as waste. I would never regret the money I spent in the past.", "options": [{"content": "What are some important ways to be responsible with your money?"}, {"content": "What are some ways that people often waste money?"}, {"content": "Do you have any regrets about how you have used money in the past?"}], "difficulty": 3, "difficultyName": "\u96be\uff08120\u4ee5\u4e0a\uff09"}, "msg": "\u8bf7\u6c42\u6210\u529f\uff01"}
