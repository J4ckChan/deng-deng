Provide reasons to support your opinion.", "answer": "From my perspective, people can definitely make a difference in terms of climate change. The first and most important reason for my argument is that individual activities can contribute to a significant change in the environment, which has already happened. For instance, after the public transportation and electric vehicles being encouraged by the government, the smog phenomena in large cities have been eased without doubts. Under the strong enforcement of appropriate legislation, the usage of plastic bags has been reduced to a large extent. Moreover, there are more and more people developing the awareness that it is our responsibility to protect the environment while taking resource from it. Therefore, an increasing number of volunteers participated in the activities to plant trees, pick up rubbish and recycle clothes. Also, the non-profit organizations have grown to perform their duties. Looking in the long run, we will obviously save the environment we are living in by ourselves.
