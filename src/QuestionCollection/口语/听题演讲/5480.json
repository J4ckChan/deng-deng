It was changing my major from bachelor of sciences to bachelor of arts. It was a big decision that I made three years ago. Initially, my parents were not being very supportive of my decision. However, after several debates with them, eventually, they compromised and decided to support me to pursue my dream. After completing the three years course, I was so proud of myself. Although as a student who had no art background, it took me a lot of effort and time to get used to the process, when I finally obtained my degree and landed a job as a user experience designer, I was so grateful for the decision that I made 3 years ago!
