The reason for my choice is that I regret not studying well and focusing on acquiring knowledge, which later on turned out to be essential in my life. In conclusion, as it is not possible for me to go back to primary school age, I will keep working to make sure that I do not regret it in the future. \uff0885 \u5b57\uff09", "difficulty": 2, "difficultyName": "\u4e00\u822c\uff08105~115\uff09"}, "msg": "\u8bf7\u6c42\u6210\u529f\uff01"}
