Why? Give specific reasons for your answer.\"", "answer": "The most meaningful achievement I have attained was my HSC. I was a very persistent person and before HSC, I clearly acknowledged my goal since Year 10 and it was to get into Actuarial Studies at UNSW. I knew it was difficult as HSC counted for the percentage, and getting a high state rank was hard. So I studied a lot and practiced a lot, and got band 6s for my Maths Extention 1 and 2, and finally made my dream come true. This was super meaningful as it gave me a chance to have the opportunity to do actuarial-related careers in the future.", "difficulty": 1, "difficultyName": "\u7b80\u5355\uff08100\u4ee5\u4e0b\uff09"}, "msg": "\u8bf7\u6c42\u6210\u529f\uff01"}
