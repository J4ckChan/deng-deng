Do you agree or disagree? Give specific reasons for your answer.\"", "answer": "Playing a game itself is fun whether people win or lose. At the end of a game, there is always one winner, but that does not mean that other players have not enjoyed the game. First of all, I believe that games must be played for an enjoyment purpose. If people all play games for the sake of winning, then their focus will be on the target, which is good. But on the other hand, players should not be involved deeply in a game if they lost it. Secondly, I am convinced that participation in a game is of greater value than winning it. It is not always important to win the game. Participants can learn lots of things during the course. Playing games is supposed to be a great way to find out more about each other, to communicate and learn new things.
